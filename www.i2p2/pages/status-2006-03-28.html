<pre>Hi y'all, tuesday rolls around again

* Index
1) Net status and 0.6.1.13
2) Use case survey
3) ???

* 1) Net status and 0.6.1.13

Things were progressing fairly smoothly on 0.6.1.12, and the
new 0.6.1.13 release has some updates to help users on both
low bandwidth and highly congested links.  There have been some
reports of problems regarding load throttling on high bandwidth
links and on some of the netDb changes, so I'm working on fixes
now.  Affected users will likely have a release available later
on in the week, perhaps by the weekend.

* 2) Use case survey

There are more reasons why one needs anonymity than you can
shake a stick at, but trying to serve them all is impossible.
What use cases matter to *you*?  Laudable as it is,
&quot;supporting anonymity&quot; isn't a use case (there is no /use/ in
there), so please be as specific as you can be (using whatever
anonymizing means you feel are appropriate).  Some examples:
 - anonymous web browsing (outproxying)
 - secure chatting (&quot;otr++&quot;)
 - anonymous internet mail (sending and receiving)
 - anonymously hosted &amp; publicly reachable blogs
 - anonymously hosted &amp; publicly reachable forums/boards/wikis
 - anonymously hosted &amp; publicly reachable bt trackers
 - pseudonymous file distribution
 - anonymous file sharing

Your help in listing specific use cases, as well as their
relative importance /to you/ is much appreciated.

* 3) ???

Thats about it for now.  This post is unsigned as I'm
experiencing some hardware failures at the moment, but those'll
be sorted soon.  Anyway, see y'all in a few minutes for the
meeting!
