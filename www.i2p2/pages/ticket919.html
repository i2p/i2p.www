<p>The issue described on this page only affects Windows systems that originally installed I2P
with version 0.9.5. Other operating systems are not affected.
</p>
<p>This issue has been corrected as of the <a href="http://mirror.i2p2.de/i2pinstall_0.9.5-win1_windows.exe">0.9.5-win1 release</a>.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A change was introduced during the 0.9.5 cycle to allow I2P's configuration files to be edited with the standard
   Windows text editor, <code>Notepad</code>.  This change had the unfortunate side-effect of causing our eepsite migration code to
   fail to run on Windows systems, leading to eepsites being served from the installation directory. Consequently:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>depending upon how I2P is started, the eepsite may not be accessible; and</li>
   <li>confusion ensues&mdash;all documentation states that eepsites are served from the profile path; and</li>
   <li>the update to Jetty 7, included in the 0.9.6 release, will fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>While no action is required for users that are not hosting an eepsite (or are not using the included Jetty to host an eepsite), it is
recommended to follow this procedure to avoid issues in case you decide to run a Jetty-hosted eepsite in the future. If you are running an
eepsite it is important to follow this procedure prior to upgrading to 0.9.6.

</p>

<h2>Fixing the configuration</h2>
<p>Because this issue causes the migration code to not run, the path in <code>%APPDATA%\I2P\clients.config</code> isn't
   updated to use an absolute path for the Jetty config file, requiring the path to be set manually. Experienced users
   can set the correct path in <code>clients.config</code> directly and restart I2P, but this page will explain how to
   correct the problem from within the router console.
</p>

<ol>
   <li>From the Home page of the I2P Router Console, click the I2P logo in the upper-left corner.
       <a href="/_static/images/ticket919/home.png">
       <img alt="" style="padding:10px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/_static/images/ticket919/home.png" /></a>
   </li>
   <li>Click the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclient">I2P Services</a> link.
       <a href="/_static/images/ticket919/i2p-services.png">
       <img alt="" style="padding:10px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/_static/images/ticket919/i2p-services.png" /></a>
       You should see something like the following:
       <a href="/_static/images/ticket919/paths.png">
       <img alt="" style="padding:10px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/_static/images/ticket919/paths.png" /></a>
       If the path at number 1 in the image above is set to <code>eepsite/jetty.xml</code>, the path needs to be updated.
   </li>
   <li>Click the <code>Edit</code> button next to <em>I2P webserver (eepsite)</em>. The page will reload to allow the path to be edited as shown below:
       <a href="/_static/images/ticket919/edit.png">
       <img alt="" style="padding:10px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/_static/images/ticket919/edit.png" /></a>
       Insert the full path to your I2P configuration directory <em>before</em> the text "eepsite/jetty.xml" as shown above,
       then click Click the <code>Save Client Configuration</code> button.
   </li>
   <li> If you're hosting an eepsite, move its contents to its proper home at <code>%APPDATA%\I2P\eepsite\docroot</code>.
   </li>
   <li>At this point you should restart your I2P router.</li>
</ol>

<p>After following the steps outlined above, your eepsite will be served from <code>%APPDATA%\I2P\eepsite\docroot</code>
   and should be accessible at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7658">http://127.0.0.1:7658</a>.
