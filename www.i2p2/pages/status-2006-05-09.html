Hi y'all, tuesday rolls 'round once again

* Index
1) Net status and 0.6.1.18
2) baz
3) ???

* 1) Net status and 0.6.1.18

After another week of testing and tweaking, we pushed out a new
release earlier this afternoon which should get us into a more
stable environment to make improvements from.  We probably won't
see much effect until it gets widely deployed though, so we may have
to wait a few days to see how it goes, but measurements will of
course continue.

One aspect of the latest builds and releases that zzz brought up
the other day was that increasing the number of backup tunnels now
can have a substantial impact when done while reducing the number of
parallel tunnels.  We don't build new leases until we have a
sufficient number of live tunnels, so the backup tunnels can be
quickly deployed in case of a live tunnel failure, reducing the
frequency of a client being without an active lease.  This is just a
tweak to a symptom though, and the latest release should help
address the root cause.

* 2) baz

&quot;baz&quot;, the new machine bar donated has finally arrived, an amd64
turion laptop (with winxp on the boot disk, and a few other OSes in
the offing through the external drives).  I've been working it over
for the last few days too, trying to test a few deployment ideas on
it.  One problem I'm running into though is getting gcj working on
windows.  More specifically, a gcj with a modern gnu/classpath.  The
word on the street is pretty negative though - it can be built
either natively in mingw or cross compiled from linux, but it has
problems like segfaulting whenever an exception crosses a dll
boundary.  So, for instance, if java.io.File (located in libgcj.dll)
throws an exception, if its caught by something in net.i2p.*
(located in libi2p.dll or i2p.exe), *poof*, there goes the app.

Yeah, so its not looking too hot.  The gcj folks would be very
interested if someone could jump in and help out with the win32
development, but viable support doesn't seem to be anything
imminent.  So, looks like we'll have to plan on continuing to use a
sun jvm on windows, while supporting gcj/kaffe/sun/ibm/etc on *nix.
I suppose thats not really that bad though, since its the *nix users
who have problems packaging and distributing jvms.

* 3) ???

Ok, I'm already late for the meeting, so I should wrap this up and
tab over to the irc window, I suppose... see you in a few ;)
