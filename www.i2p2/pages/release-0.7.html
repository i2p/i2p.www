I2P release 0.7
=====================

The 0.7 release adds stability and flexibility to I2PSnark,
which can hopefully be used to distribute I2P updates in future.

The I2P router gets fixes and optimizations to various
transport-level and streaming issues, network exploration,
NetDB performance and the UDP introducer system. Among other features,
the new release offers better connection limiting, higher tolerance
to "out of memory" exceptions in helper applications, and an
experimental new address system using Base32 hashes
of destination keys (".b32.i2p" URLs).

Both the BOB and SAM protocols are improved upon,
more old components dropped, Router Console features added
and a possible latency measurement attack mitigated.
- From this release onwards, block lists for misbehaving peers
are activated by default.

It seems worthwhile to remind that already since
the last release, I2P requires Java 1.5 or higher.
If you are uncertain about your Java version, you can verify
by opening a terminal window or command prompt, and entering
the command "java -version". If you have an older Java installed,
please update it first!

This release is backward compatible: if you already have
0.6.1.31 or greater installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file, and you can update automatically.

As customary, for people who don't have the option
of checking GPG signatures, supplied below are the
SHA1 hashes of released files:
