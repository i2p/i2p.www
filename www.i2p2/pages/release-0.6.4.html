I2P release 0.6.4
=====================

The 0.6.4 release adds performance and stability improvements.
Floodfill peers which are already connected, are preferred
for RouterInfo stores, and references to new floodfill peers
obtained from ordinary peers in case of shortage.

Preference for already connected peers is generally increased
by considering them active. Timeouts during tunnel joins
are now counted against peer profiles.

Improvements to the shutdown handler, tunnel builder,
router throttling, collection of tunnel pool statistics,
as well as router console and I2PSnark improvements
(and texts to explain reachability issues) are also included.

This release is backward compatible: if you already have
0.6.1.31 or greater installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file, and you can update automatically.

As customary, for people who don't have the option
of checking GPG signatures, supplied below are the
