Hi y'all

* Index
1) 0.4.2.3
2) i2p-bt
3) #idlerpg
4) ???

jrandom said he'd probably not make it to the meeting today,
so we have to do it without him 

* 1) 0.4.2.3

Expected to be released tomorrow or thursday. It contains a
lot of fixes [1], a lot are SAM related.

* 2) i2p-bt

Yesterday a new version of the i2p bittorrent client was
released [2], version 0.1.3. It seems to work better than
before, also thanks due to the SAM fixes, though there is
still some weird behaviour.
There have been several requests to improve the GUI. 
I, duck, have never done any GUI coding in Python, so it is
not likely that this will happen soon; hopefully someone
jumps in to assist here.

* 3) Idle RPG - #idlerpg

Some fun RPG which you can join [3] while you are on IRC
anyway, you don't have to do anything besides idleing.

See you in the meeting at 21:00 UTC.
