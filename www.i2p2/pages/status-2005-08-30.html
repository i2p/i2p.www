Hi y'all, its that time of the week again

* 1) Net status

With 0.6.0.3 out for a week, the reports are pretty good, though the
logging and display has been pretty confusing for some.  As of a few
minutes ago, I2P is reporting that a substantial number of people
have misconfigured their NATs or firewalls though - out of 241 peers,
41 have seen the status go to ERR-Reject, while 200 have been
straight OK (when they can get an explicit status).  This is not
good, but it has helped focus what needs to be done a bit further.

Since the release, there have been a few bugfixes for long standing
error conditions, bringing the current CVS HEAD up to 0.6.0.3-4,
which will likely be pushed out as 0.6.0.4 later this week.

* 2) floodfill netDb

As discussed [1] in my blog [2], we're trying out a new backwards
compatible netDb which will address both the restricted route
situation we're seeing (20% of the routers) and simplify things a
bit.  The floodfill netDb is deployed as part of 0.6.0.3-4 without
any further configuration, and basically works by querying within
the floodfill db before falling back onto the existing kademlia
db.  If a few people want to help try it out, swing on up to
0.6.0.3-4 and give 'er a whirl!

* 3) Syndie

Syndie development is progressing quite well, with the full remote
syndication in operation and optimized for I2P's needs (minimizing
the number of HTTP requests, instead bundling results and uploads in
multipart HTTP posts).  The new remote syndication means you can run
your own local Syndie instance, reading and posting offline, and
then later on, sync your Syndie with someone else's - pulling down
any new posts and pushing up any locally created posts (either in
bulk, by blog, or by post).

One public Syndie site is syndiemedia.i2p (also reachable on the web
at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://syndiemedia.i2p.net/">http://syndiemedia.i2p.net/</a>) with its public archives reachable
at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://syndiemedia.i2p/archive/archive.txt">http://syndiemedia.i2p/archive/archive.txt</a> (point your Syndie node
at that to sync it).  The 'front page' on that syndiemedia has been
filtered to include only my blog, by default, but you can still
access the other blogs through the drop down and adjust your default
accordingly.  (over time, syndiemedia.i2p's default will change to
a set of introductory posts and blogs, giving a good entry point
into syndie).

One effort still underway is the internationalization of the Syndie
codebase.  I've got my local copy modified to work properly with any
content (any character set / locale / etc) on any machine (with
potentially differing character sets / locale / etc), serving up the
data clean so that the user's browser can interpret it properly.  I
have run into problems with one Jetty component that Syndie uses
though, as their class for dealing with internationalized multipart
requests isn't character set conscious.  Yet ;)

Anyway, that means that once the internationalization part is
sorted, content and blogs will be renderable and editable across all
languages (but not translated, of course, yet).  Until then though,
content created may get b0rked once the internationalization is
finished (since there are UTF-8 strings inside the signed content
areas).  But stil, feel free to hack around, and hopefully I'll get
things finished tonight or tomorrow sometime.

Also, some ideas still on the horizon for SML [3] include a
[torrent attachment=&quot;1&quot;]my file[/torrent] tag which would offer a
one click way to let people fire off the attached torrent in their
favorite BT client (susibt, i2p-bt, azneti2p, or even a non-i2p bt
client).  Is there demand for other sorts of hooks (e.g. an [ed2k]
tag?), or do people have entirely different crazy ideas for pushing
content in Syndie?

Anyway, lots and lots going on, so swing by the meeting in 10 minutes
on irc://irc.{postman,arcturus,freshcoffee}.i2p/#i2p or freenode.net!
