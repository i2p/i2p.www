<p>
Release 0.7.8 contains initial support for router console translations, and
changes to the floodfill system which lay the foundation for supporting large growth in the network.
</p><p>
To prevent easy blocking of I2P by malicious firewalls, the release randomizes the I2P port for new installs.
For existing installs, please help those who are vulnerable to blocking by changing UDP from 8887 to a random port on
and adjusting your firewall if necessary.
</p><p>
The release also contains more changes to reduce memory and CPU usage,
and a large assortment of bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.
We especially encourage those of you still running release 0.7.6 or earlier to upgrade as soon as possible.
Please give the
developers feedback on IRC #i2p or <a href="http://forum.i2p2.de/">forum.i2p2.de</a>
and <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html">get involved</a>
or <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html">donate</a>!
We are also looking for help on new and existing translations.
Please volunteer on IRC #i2p.

Release details:

<p><strong>Network Database</strong></p>

<p>- Partially reintroduce Kademlia to the network database, by having each floodfill store only a portion of the keyspace. Routers will query and store to a floodfill that is closest to the key in question. Floodfills will only flood to peers closest to the key.
<br />- The limit on number of floodfills will not be raised in this release. Therefore, there will be no immediate change; all floodfills will store the entire keyspace. In future releases, the limit will be raised until most class O routers will be floodfill. After that, each floodfill be be responsible for about 300 netdb entries, independent of network size, thus allowing i2p to scale to many thousands of routers.
<br />- The release also fixes a bad bug that was preventing verification of RouterInfo stores.</p>

<p><strong>Router Console Translation Support</strong></p>

<p>- The router console now supports translation to other languages using standard &quot;po&quot; files. Initial string tagging by &quot;walking&quot;.

<br />- The HTTP proxy now supports translated error pages.
<br />- Chinese translation (by &quot;walking&quot;) is included.
<br />- French translation (by &quot;neutron&quot;) is included.
<br />- German translation (by &quot;echelon&quot;) is included.
<br />- Translation of bundled applications (i2psnark, i2ptunnel, susimail, susidns) is not yet supported, it will be included in a future release.
<br />- We are searching for additional translation volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>Streaming Lib</strong></p>

<p>- Improve the handling of immediate ack requests, hopefully this will help network speed.</p>

<p><strong>Peer Profiles</strong></p>

<p>- Additions to store statistics on netdb performance, to assist floodfill peer selection
<br />- Reduction in storage for non-floodfill peers, to save about 2MB RAM</p>

<p><strong>Transport</strong></p>

<p>- To prevent easy blocking by malicious firewalls (matching source or destination port 8887), new I2P installs will now use a random port between 9000 and 32000. Users who have previously installed i2p are encouraged to change their port to make blocking more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>I2PSnark</strong></p>

<p>- Raise piece size limit from 1MB to 2MB</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>- Continued cleanup of the code to reduce package size and memory usage
<br />- Continued console cleanup</p>
