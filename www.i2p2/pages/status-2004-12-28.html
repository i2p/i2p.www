Hi y'all, time for a quick update on things

* Index
1) 0.4.2.5
2) 0.5
3) ???

* 1) 0.4.2.5

The 0.4.2.5 release has gone pretty well - most people updated
within a day or two (thanks!) and there haven't really been any
show stoppers since - IRC has been more reliable than usual,
transfer rates have improved, tunnel failures reduced, and the
ambient network load has shrunk so much that people have been
complaining.

Its not all motherhood and apple pie though, and I've been tracking
down some intermittent problems with the sdk and streaming lib where
connections are both failing prematurely and taking longer than they
should be to propogate messages.  I know there's the law of
diminishing returns going on here, and I'm not going to keep
tweaking and tweaking until its 100% perfect, but I believe there
are still some measurable improvements left to be made.

* 2) 0.5

Luckily (?), I had some hardware failures last week which bumped me
offline for a few days, giving me time to get out the pen &amp; paper to
work through more details of the 0.5 tunnel management code.
Nothing substantial to report here yet though.

* 3) ???

Very brief summary, I know, but most of the work over the last week
has been on paper.  As mentioned [1] on the list, Connelly is
running an intersection attack against some eepsites, so once
there's some data to report on, I'm sure he'll give us the scoop.
Anyone else have anything to bring up - if so, swing on by the
meeting.
