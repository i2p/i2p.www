<h3>2013-08-10: <b>0.9.7.1 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.7.1.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>This unscheduled release disables the RouterInfo verification messages that were used in the
<a href="http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~spjsschl/i2p.pdf">UCSB "practical attacks" paper</a>,
which should make correlating a LeaseSet and a Router much more difficult.
We have also included a limited number of other fixes listed below.
Our 0.9.8 release, which will include IPv6 support, is still on-schedule for late September.
As usual, we recommend that all users update to this release.
