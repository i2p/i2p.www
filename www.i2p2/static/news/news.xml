<h3>2013-03-08: <b>0.9.5 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.5.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>0.9.5 includes several bug fixes and defenses for some issues and vulnerabilities
 that are being investigated by researchers at UCSB. We continue to work with them
 on additional improvements. This is a good opportunity to remind the community that
 while our network is improving and growing rapidly, it is still relatively small. There may
 be multiple weaknesses or bugs that could compromise your anonymity. Help us grow
 the network by spreading the word and contributing where you can.</p>

<p>In this upgrade cycle, a random 1% of routers, (plus all routers running a
 development build) will attempt to update via the experimental in-network bittorrent
 with i2psnark. If this doesn't work, it should fall back to standard in-network HTTP update.
