<p>There has been discussion about a distributed blogging application for a few
months now called "MyI2P".  While the original discussions were lost, we were 
able to retrieve a google <a href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/i2p.net/myi2p.html">cache</a>
of it.  It isn't pretty, but it includes the basic overview and some discussion
that ensued.</p>

<p>The application itself is not yet implemented, and the ideas behind it have 
been made less ambitious over time, but they are still valid and the current 
<a href="roadmap">plan</a> is to have the core MyI2P functionality available 
along side the I2P 1.0 release.  That will include a distributed address book
to enable secure, distributed, and human readable naming by sacrificing the 
need for global uniqueness - basically everyone has their own local address book 
and can 'subscribe' to other people's address books, letting MyI2P periodically
retrieve new name to destination mappings (leaving conflicts up to the user to
resolve).  In addition to the address book, there will be a distributed blogging
system using a reduced and secured subset of 
<a href="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/faq.php?mode=bbcode">bbcode</a> to essentially
provide an anonymous <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> with
a 'friends list' and transparent access control (authenticated by the I2P
<a href="datagrams">datagrams</a> with rules defined based on the address book).</p>

<p>Additional functionality, such as integration with a DHT backing store or 
swarming file transfers for 'attachments' can be added later.  Email may or may
not get in the first pass either, though its implementation is essentially just
a blog entry with private access, so perhaps some UI designer can come up with
something.  Exporting the data to RSS or access through ATOM will be an option 
down the road as well.</p>
