   :excerpt: 0.9.3 includes extensive low-level changes to the queueing of messages in the router.
             We implement the CoDel Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm. We also unify the
             queueing and priority mechanisms in the transports to aid diagnosis and reduce network
             latency. Work continues on fixing UDP transport bugs and making UDP more resistant to
             attacks. There are more changes to improve the performance of the router and reduce its
             memory usage. Also, we enable i2psnark's DHT support, introduced last release, by default.
