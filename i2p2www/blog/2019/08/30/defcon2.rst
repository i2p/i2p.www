==============================================

{% trans -%}
I went to Def Con 27 last weekend to give a workshop on I2P application
development, and to meet zzz, mhatta, and Alex in person.

My workshop went well, we even had a few application developers attend! In
particular I had a pretty lengthy conversation with a person named Mary about
how I2P could be used to eliminate centralization and enhance privacy in
a "Magic Wormhole" type of application. While I wasn't totally familiar with
Magic Wormhole at the time, I think most of my advice was usable. I think Mary
had some very interesting and workable ideas about sharing information in more
human-centric ways that could be interesting in I2P applications, and am looking
forward to experimenting with some of those.

The materials I made for the application development workshop are available on
Github! https://github.com/eyedeekay/defcon Please consider it a living document,
your input is desired! As it is licensed permissively, you are free to fork it
and make it your own as well. Share your examples, your hacks, or correct my
comma use, complain about my document preparation style, or just print off your
own copy in booklet form!

I also talked to a guy who gives advice to the government about the differences
between I2P and Tor, why I2P is more P2P-friendly, and some scenarios in which
peers in a P2P application might want to have enhanced privacy from each-other,
and why I2P is perhaps uniquely suited to accomplish that.

In general, both the application development workshops went well, even though
they didn't go entirely according to plan in that only a small proportion of the
audience were application developers. The impression I got was that many people
are very interested in I2P, but also many people are confused by how interacting
with I2P works. By re-focusing on their questions and by teaming off with zzz,
mhatta, and Alex we were fairly successful at dealing with our audience, which
was more varied in terms of occupation, interest, and I2P knowledge than
expected.

Besides that, I also talked to Alex about my experimental contextual-identity
driven I2P proxy plugin for Firefox and eventually, Brave Browser. Got to talk
a little about bundling, but not too much, as it was a very busy convention. I'm
looking forward to following up with him on that soon.

mhatta and I almost won a lobster from a claw machine, but it was a real
fighter and got away at the last second. Really thought I had it for a moment
though. :)

To add to zzz's notes for next time, aside from being more general I believe our
workshops would not have been as able to adapt to the needs of the audience
without the support of mhatta and Alex. Having people who can help particpants
individually or in small groups was immensely helpful, many, many thanks to both
of them for helping us out.
