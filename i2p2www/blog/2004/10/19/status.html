Hi y'all, its tuesday again

* Index
1) 0.4.1.3
2) Tunnel test time, and send processing time
3) Streaming lib
4) files.i2p
5) ???

* 1) 0.4.1.3

The 0.4.1.3 release came out a day or two ago and it looks like most
people have upgraded (thanks!).  The net is working fairly well, but
still no revolutionary increase in reliability.  However, the
watchdog bugs from 0.4.1.2 have gone away (or at least no one has
mentioned them).  My aim is for this 0.4.1.3 release to be the last
patch before 0.4.2, though of course if something big comes up
needing fixing, we'll have another one.

* 2) Tunnel test time, and send processing time

The most significant changes in the 0.4.1.3 release were to the
tunnel testing - rather than having a fixed (30 second!) test period,
we have much more aggressive timeouts that are derived from measured
performance.  This is good, as we now mark tunnels as failing when
they are too slow to do anything useful.  However, this is bad, as
sometimes tunnels get backed up temporarily, and if we test them
during that period we fail a tunnel that would otherwise work.

A recent plot of how long a tunnel test takes on one router:

  <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/10sTestTime.png">http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/10sTestTime.png</a>

Those are generally ok tunnel test times - they pass through 4 remote
peers (with 2 hop tunnels), giving the bulk of them ~1-200ms per hop.
 However, thats not always the case, as you can see - sometimes it
takes on the order of seconds per hop.

Thats where this next plot comes in - the queue time from when one
particular router wanted to send a message to when that message was
flushed out a socket:

  <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/processingTime.png">http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/processingTime.png</a>

The top 95% or so are under 50ms, but the spikes are killer.

We need to get rid of those spikes, as well as work around situations
with more failing peers.  As it stands now, when we 'learn' about a
peer failing our tunnels, we aren't really learning anything
particular to their router - those spikes can cause even high
capacity peers to seem slow if we hit it right.

* 3) Streaming lib

The second part of getting around failing tunnels will be
accomplished in part by the streaming lib - giving us much more
robust end to end streaming communication.  This discussion is
nothing new - the lib will do all the whizbang stuff we've been
talking about for a while (and it'll have its share of bugs, of
course).  There has been a lot of progress on this front, and the
implementation is probably 60% there.

More news when there's more news.

* 4) files.i2p

Ok, we've had a lot of new eepsites lately, which is kickass. I just
want to point out this one especially as its got a pretty neat
feature for the rest of us.  If you haven't been to files.i2p, its
basically a google-like search engine, with a cache of the sites it
spiders (so you can both search and browse when the eepsite is
offline).  v.cool.

* 5) ???

This week's status notes are pretty brief, but there's lots going on
- - I just don't have time to write more before the meeting. So, swing
on by #i2p in a few minutes and we can discuss whatever I foolishly
overlooked.
