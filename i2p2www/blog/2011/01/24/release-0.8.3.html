<p>
The 0.8.3 release contains several performance improvements, including reduction of threads and
memory usage, and faster I2CP (client-router) communication.
</p><p>
There is also new SSL router console support,
a new reseed configuration page including HTTP proxy support for those behind restrictive firewalls,
a new I2CP configuration section including I2CP-over-SSL support for remote clients,
a new server connection limits and blacklist configuration section for enhanced DoS protection,
and a new
HTTP proxy jump server configuration section so you may easily add alternative jump servers.
Statistics are now limited by default to reduce memory usage; the full set of statistics may be re-enabled on the
stats configuration page.
There are also bug fixes, of course, so
as usual, upgrading is recommended.
