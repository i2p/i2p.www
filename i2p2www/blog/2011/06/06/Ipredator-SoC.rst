I have been commissioned to contribute code to I2P during the summer of 2011, implementing a control protocol and a client for this protocol (similar to `Vidalia`_ for Tor).
This work was the idea of Jan-Erik Fiske of `ViaEuropa`_ and Peter Sunde of `flattr`_ and `The Pirate Bay`_ fame and its funding will be generously provided by `Relakks`_ and `Ipredator`_.
