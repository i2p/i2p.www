We're excited to share some news: StormyCloud is officially joining forces with I2P in a more significant way.

For years, StormyCloud has been a critical part of I2P's infrastructure, providing hosting and support that keeps the network running.
Now we're formalizing that partnership and expanding what we can do together.

We're particularly glad to announce that Lance James and idk are joining StormyCloud's Board of Directors.
Lance founded the Invisible Internet Project, which evolved into what we now know as I2P, and his experience building privacy-focused networks goes back decades.
idk has been extensively involved in I2P development for years — if you use I2P, you've benefited from his work.

Starting now, you can support I2P development through cryptocurrency, credit/debit cards, and bank transfers.
All donations go directly to I2P: software development, infrastructure, research, and documentation.
StormyCloud processes these as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, making them tax-deductible for U.S. donors.

This partnership gives us more resources and stability to grow I2P while staying true to what makes it work: a decentralized, community-driven network that puts privacy first.
I2P remains what it's always been: a community-driven project.
Development happens in the open, decisions are made collectively, and the network exists because people choose to run it.
That hasn't changed and won't change.
We're looking forward to what comes next.
