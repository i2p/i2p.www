Hi y'all, its that time of the week again,

* Index
1) Net status
2) SSU status
3) Roadmap update
4) Q status
5) ???

* 1) Net status

Over the nearly two weeks since 0.5.0.6 came out, things have been
mostly positive, though service providers (eepsites, ircd, etc) have
been running into some bugs as of late.  While clients are in good
shape, over time a server may run into situation where failing
tunnels can trigger some excessive throttling code, preventing
proper rebuilding and publication of the leaseSet.

There have been some fixes in CVS, among other things, and I expect
that we'll have a new 0.5.0.7 out in the next day or so.

* 2) SSU status

For those not following my (oh so exciting) blog, there's been a lot
of progress with the UDP transport, and right now its fairly safe to
say that the UDP transport will not be our throughput bottleneck :)
While debugging that code, I've taken the opportunity to work
through the queueing at higher levels as well, finding points where
we can remove unnecessary choke points.  As I said last week,
though, there's still a lot of work to do.  More info will be
available when there's more info available.

* 3) Roadmap update

Its april now, so the roadmap [1] has been updated accordingly -
dropping 0.5.1 and shifting some dates.  The big change there is
moving 0.6 from April to June, though that really isn't as big of a
change as it looks like.  As I mentioned last week, my own schedule
has moved around a bit, and rather than moving to $somewhere in
June, I'm moving to $somewhere in May.  While we could have whats
necessary for 0.6 ready this month, there is no way I'm going to
shove out a major update like that and then dissapear for a month,
since the reality of software is that there'll be bugs not caught
in testing.

* 4) Q status

Aum has been going wild on Q, putting in more goodies for us, with
the latest screenshots up on his site [2].  He has also committed
the code to CVS too (yay), so we'll hopefully be able to begin alpha
testing soon.  I'm sure we'll hear more from aum with details on how
to help, or you can dig into the goods in CVS at i2p/apps/q/

* 5) ???

There has been lots more going on as well, with some lively
discussions on the mailing list, the forum, and irc.  I'm not
going to try to summarize those here, since there are only a few
minutes until the meeting, but swing on by if there's something not
discussed that you want to bring up!
