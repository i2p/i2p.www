Hi y'all, weekly uptime time

* 1) Net status

The 0.6.1.5 release has gone pretty well, and the network continues
to be fairly stable.  The revised Syndie has been getting a bit more
activity, with feedback leeding to further enhancements.  zzz has
also done some hacking on stats.i2p, giving us a slick little
network dashboard [1], and orion has been updated [2] as well (w3wt)

Performance has been improving too, but not to the degree that I'm
looking for, yet.  Progress continues on that front, with some
pretty neat stuff lined up for 0.6.1.6, as well as the usual
spattering of bugfixes, of course.  I hope to have 0.6.1.6 out later
this week, but it won't be today.

Raccoon23 has posted up an interesting idea for helping get more
peer review for I2P's anonymity [3].  The more I think about it the
more I like it, though I think Raccoon23 is probably right in that
we want to wait until 0.9/1.0-beta before running these types of
contests.  We could even do different contests for different
applications on top of I2P - one for eepsites, one for irc users,
one for I2Phex users, one for anon-BT users, one for Syndie users,
etc.  This, meshed with the suggestion of trying with both passive
'foxes' and fairly advanced 'foxes' should give us the opportunity
for a good selection of threats.

Perhaps we should mull these over further, and revisit this as we
approach 1.0.

There's lots going on, even though only a few agenda items on this
week's list :)  Raccoon23's latest analysis is pretty interesting,
we've heard reports of improved reliability and reduced load on
underpowered/low bandwidth connections, and we're finding more
and more opportunities for optimization through the simulators.
Anyways, as always, if you've got any questions or ideas to bring
up, swing on by #i2p at 8p UTC tonight for our weekly dev meeting
and be heard!
