Hi gang, another brief update this week, but with some important stuff

* Index
1) 0.6
2) ???

* 1) 0.6

Things are looking pretty good on the SSU front, and I don't see any
showstoppers which are holding us back from pushing out as 0.6.  As
such, we'll be going live with a new 0.6 release later this week -
lets pencil it in for tomorrow (wednesday).  The 0.6 rev is NOT going
to be backwards compatible, so we should expect it to be a bit bumpy,
but everyone should upgrade to it as soon as its out.  That includes
people already running 0.5.0.7-19 (or later), as I've held off from
committing the switch to a few vars making it incompatible.

Updating will be simple, though people will want to read the instructions
when they come out (especially those who will need to adjust their
firewall/NAT for UDP communication).  There are still some long standing
issues we've been trying to track down, but they're not SSU related so
we can fairly safely continue.

* 2) ???

Thats it for the moment, and yeah, still no meeting this week (though
there's a chance that they'll be back in two weeks or so... not sure
yet).  As always, if someone has something (*cough*relevent*cough*) to
bring up, please don't hesitate to post it on the list or on the forum.
