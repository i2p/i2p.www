Hi y'all, 'tis tuesday again

* 1) 0.6.1.7 and net status

Last thursday brought out a new bugfix release of I2P, and with 70%
of the network upgraded, it seems to have done the trick.  Some
people are still getting high tunnel participation counts, but not
as many as before.  Over the last few days we've also had a bit of a
surge in new users, according to stats.i2p, though churn is still
fairly high.  There have been some high load situations recently
though, but that seems to be due to...

* 2) Experimental tunnel failures

zzz has been digging through the published stats and monitoring the
local router, and we've got a pretty substantial tunnel creation
failure rate, especially with longer tunnels.  According to zzz.i2p,
that particular router is getting abysmal creation success - 3 hop
exploratory tunnels are successfully built only 0.47% of the time,
with 1 hop exploratory tunnels built successfully 7.5% of the time.
There's some progress on a patch to the router up on that site too,
and we'll hopefully be getting that into 0.6.1.8.

The failure rate will hopefully be going away with 0.6.2, since
we'll have that modified tunnel creation / crypto.  However, 0.6.2
is currently on the back burner while performance is still being
optimized.  However, the failure rate does have performance
implications itself, so we may need to move forward in any case.
I'm currently running some modified network load tests to determine
the throttle point.  We'll see how things progress.

* 3) SSU and NATs

The other day bar posted [1] a discussion regarding what NAT
topologies our SSU transport will deal with, and what we can do to
get better results.  As bar states in the summary, the view that
I2P outright doesn't support symmetric NATs isn't quite true, but,
with care, we can support them in some careful situations.
Hopefully we can continue to review how the SSU protocol and
implementation can be enhanced to enable transparent operation for
more users.

* 4) Syndie

There has been a lot of progress on Syndie lately, with much
of the discussion going on within Syndie itself [2].  While progress
continues regarding Syndie's threaded display, there's also some
thoughts about the blog-like display, as well as a main entrypoint
for an archive, such as with niceman's proposal [3].  I expect we'll
see some progress on that front soon.

Polecat has also been working on improving SML itself, and CofE has
suggested some enhancements to allow multipage posts, so hopefully
we'll get some of those in place too.  There has also been work on
exporting the data in XML and XML/RDF, and a first pass of that is
already implemented in CVS (see the history.txt for details [4]).
It'd be great to use those to feed rich client apps for slick
navigation and wysiwyg editing.

I've also been putting together some tech details about how Syndie
works, with two posts in Syndie so far [5].  There'll be more info
posted later, of course.

* 5) ???

There is lots going on, both within the core and the app level, and
I'm leaving out some things that may not be ready for public
consumption yet too.  But if people have things they'd like to
discuss, swing on by the meeting in -10 minutes and get your rant
on :)
