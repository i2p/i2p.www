* 1) Net status

As many have seen, the 0.6.0.5 release came out last week after a
brief 0.6.0.4 rev, and so far, the reliability has been greatly
improved, and the net has grown larger than ever.  There is still
some room for improvement, but it seems that the new netDb is
performing as designed.  We've even had the fallback tested out -
when the floodfill peers are unreachable, routers fall back on the
kademlia netDb, and the other day when that scenario occurred, irc
and eepsite reliability was not substantially diminished.

I did receive a question regarding how the new netDb works, and have
posted up the answer [1] on my blog [2].  As always, if anyone has
any questions on that sort of thing, please feel free to bounce it
my way, either on or off list, on the forum, or even on your blog ;)

* 2) Syndie status

As you can see from syndiemedia.i2p (and <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://syndiemedia.i2p.net/">http://syndiemedia.i2p.net/</a>),
there has been a lot of progress lately, including RSS, pet names,
administrative controls, and the beginnings of reasonable css usage.
Most of Isamoor's suggestions have been deployed as well, as have
Adam's, so if anyone has anything in mind they'd like to see in
there, please bounce me a note!

Syndie is now fairly close to beta, at which point it'll be shipped
as one of the default I2P applications as well as packaged
standalone, so any help would be greatly appreciated.  With today's
latest additions (in cvs), skinning Syndie is a snap too - you can
just create a new file syndie_standard.css in your i2p/docs/
directory, and the styles specified will override Syndie's defaults.
More info on that can be found on my blog [2].

* 3) susidns

Susi has whipped up yet another web application for us - susidns [3].
This serves as a simple interface for managing the addressbook app -
its entries, subscriptions, etc.  Its looking pretty good, so
hopefully we'll be able to ship it as one of the default apps soon,
but for now, its a snap to grab from her eepsite, save it to your
webapps directory, restart your router, and you're good to go.

* 4) ???

While we've certainly been focusing on the client app side of things
(and will continue to do so), much of my time is still targetting
the core operation of the network, and there's some exciting stuff
coming down the pipe - firewall and NAT hopping with introductions,
improved SSU autoconfiguration, advanced peer ordering and selection,
and even some simple restricted route handling.  On the website
front, HalfEmpty has made some improvements to our stylesheets
(yay!).

Anyway, lots going on, but thats about all I've got time to mention
at the moment, but swing on by the meeting at 8p UTC and say hi :)
