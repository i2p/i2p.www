I2PCon is the first event of its kind. It has two short term goals. Where the first one is to provide the general public with an event where knowledge about privacy and privacy concerns can be obtained. The second goal is to further the I2P project and its community. This will take the shape of technical discussions about cryptography, anonymity and I2P centric topics.

There is a larger and more long-term goal of this event, and it is to build a commnutiy of privacy concious individuals. By connecting people who recognize the importance of privacy, we would like to provide a forum where this community can grow.

The idea for this event was first spawned by our wonderful friends at `Toronto Crypto <https://torontocrypto.org/>`_.
The venue and everything relating to it is provided by `Hacklab <https://hacklab.to/>`_.
Without either of them this event would not have been possible, so Thank You.
