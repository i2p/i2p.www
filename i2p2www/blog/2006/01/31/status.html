Hi y'all, tuesday rolls around once again,

* Index
1) Net status
2) 0.6.1.10 status
3) ???

* 1) Net status

Over the last week, I've been trying out a few different tweaks to
increase the reliability of tunnel creation on the live net, but
there hasn't yet been a breakthrough.  There have been some
substantial changes in CVS though, but they aren't what I'd term...
stable.  So, generally, I'd recommend people either use the most
recent release (0.6.1.9, tagged in CVS as i2p_0_6_1_9), or no more
than 1 hop tunnels with the latest builds.  On the other hand...

* 2) 0.6.1.10 status

Rather than battle indefinitely with minor tweaks, I've been working
on my local test network to migrate into the new tunnel creation
crypto and process [1].  This should address a large portion of the
tunnel creation failure rate, after which we can tune it further, if
necessary.

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/doc/">http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/doc/</a>
                               tunnel-alt-creation.html?rev=HEAD

One unfortunate side effect is that 0.6.1.10 will not be backwards
compatible.  We haven't had a backwards incompatible release in a
long time, but in the early days we did it a bunch so it shouldn't
be too much of a problem.  Basically, after it works great on my
local test network, we'll roll it out in parallel to a few brave
souls for early testing, then when its ready for release, we'll just
switch the seed references to the seeds for the new network and push
'er out.

I don't have an ETA on the 0.6.1.10 release, but its looking pretty
good at the moment (most tunnel lengths are working out, but there
are a few branches I haven't stressed yet).  More news when there's
more news, of course.

* 3) ???

Thats about all I have to mention at the moment, though I know there
are things others are hacking on and there are a few tricks up my
sleeves for later, but we'll find out more when the time is right.
Anyway, see y'all in a few minutes!
