Blog overview
=============

The blog consists of a set of static files sorted into folders by date. Each
file contains the content for a single blog post.

Post format
-----------

Blog posts are written in reStructuredText format. The post contents is passed
through Jinja2 before being handed to the docutils formatter, so standard
template tags and variables can be used. This allows site-internal URLs to be
correctly generated, and text to be tagged for translation.

At the top of each post, a metadata section should be included. This is parsed
to obtain informatiion about the post for use in summaries (such as the blog
index page). The following metadata is used:

- **date**: Optional, can be used to override the URL date. If set to the same
  date as the URL date, it saves a Python split and join operation.
- **category**: Optional, enables posts to be categorized (each category has
  its own RSS feed that can be followed, in addition to the overall feed).
- **author**: Optional, if left out the default is 'I2P devs'
- **excerpt**: Summary of the post (generally the same as the first line for
  translation purposes). Required, it is displayed on the blog index.

How to use the blog
-------------------

1. Create a directory path matching the date of the blog post, e.g.
   'mkdir -p 2014/01/01'
2. Create a file in that directory with suffix '.rst'. The name of the file and
   the directory path will together be the URL that the post will be visible at
   e.g. '2014/01/01/Happy-New-Year.rst' -> '/lang/blog/post/2014/01/01/Happy-New-Year'
3. Write the blog post in reStructuredText format, taking note of the custom
   format notes above.

Writing draft posts
-------------------

To write a draft post, create the file with the suffix '.draft.rst'. Post files
with this suffix will be visible at their post URL, but will not be shown in
the blog index. To publish the draft post, change the filename to remove the
'.draft' in the suffix (e.g. mtn mv foo.draft.rst foo.rst).

Creating shortlinks
-------------------

See the comments in shortlinks.py.

How to make a release notice
----------------------------

1. Create a directory path matching the date of the release.
2. Find the blog post file for the previous release, and copy it into the new
   directory (renaming as appropriate).
3. Edit as necessary.
