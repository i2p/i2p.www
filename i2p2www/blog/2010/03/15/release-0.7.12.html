<p>
The 0.7.12 release contains support for user-generated plugins. These plugins may contain console web applications,
themes, translations, or standalone programs.
Some plugins are already available for testing.
We are hopeful this support will enable rapid development of innovative i2p applications.
</p><p>
The release fixes the blank-page bug when an eepsite is not reachable,
and also improves handling of clock skews and IP changes.
It adds support for a new, smaller tunnel build message,
that will be tested in this release and enabled in the next release.
</p><p>
As usual, the release contains more anonymity and performance improvements,
translation updates, and an assortment of other bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.
</p><p>
The last 6 months of development have dramatically increased the performance and capacity of the network.
Please help grow the network.
Please give the
developers feedback on IRC #i2p or <a href="http://forum.i2p2.de/">forum.i2p2.de</a>
and <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html">get involved</a>,
spread the word,
