"This provides researchers who run multiple routers with the means to "
"publicly identify those routers.\n"

" running an attack on the network.\n"
"It also will prevent other routers from including multiple routers of the"
" family in a single tunnel,\n"
"which could lead to deanonymization.\n"
"Routers that appear to be colluding but do not have a declared family may"
