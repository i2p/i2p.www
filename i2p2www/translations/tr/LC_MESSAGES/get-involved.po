"At its simplest, a reseed server consists of a Java I2P router, an HTTPS "
"web server,\n"
"and some scripts that periodically gather router infos from the router,\n"
"bundle and sign them into a custom file format, and deliver these files "
"over HTTPS.\n"
"In practice, it's a bit more complex, and a reseed operator must be "
"fairly competent and attentive.\n"
"A reseed server is not appropriate for a residential internet connection."
