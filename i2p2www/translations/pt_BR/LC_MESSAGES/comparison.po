"Compared to I2P, Freenet offers some substantial benefits - it is a "
"distributed data\n"
"store, while I2P is not, allowing people to retrieve the content "

"even when the publisher is no longer online.  In addition, it should be "
"able to \n"
"distribute popular data fairly efficiently.  I2P itself does not and will"

"this functionality.  On the other hand, there is overlap for users who "
"simply want to \n"

"However, even ignoring any implementations issues, there are some "
"concerns \n"
"about Freenet's algorithms from both a scalability and anonymity "
"perspective, owing \n"
"largely to Freenet's heuristic driven routing.  The interactions of "
"various techniques \n"
"certainly may successfully deter various attacks, and perhaps some "
"aspects of the \n"
"routing algorithms will provide the hoped for scalability.  "
"Unfortunately, not much\n"
"analysis of the algorithms involved has resulted in positive results, but"
" there is still\n"
"hope.  At the very least, Freenet does provide substantial anonymity "
"against an attacker\n"
"who does not have the resources necessary to analyze it further."
