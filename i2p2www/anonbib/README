anonbib 0.3 -- Code to generate the anonymity bibliography

Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Nick Mathewson
Based on 'PDOSBib' perl code by Eddie Kohler

This software is licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.

To use this software, you need to understand BibTeX and Python a
little. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.  You will need
Python 2.2 or later.

To use this package:
   - Get a good BibTeX file.  You may want to mark it up with some of the
     extra keys used in our "anonbib.bib" file.  All of the additional
     Bibtex keys we use have the prefix "www_"; check out anonbib.bib
     for their usage.

   - Edit anonbib.cfg and _template_.html and _template_bibtex.html so they
     refer to your files, authors, topics, and so on.

   - Run 'python updateCache.py anonbib.cfg' to create a local cache of the
     papers in your bibliography based on their www_*_url entries.  (By
     default, the script will ignore any entries you have already cached.  To
     force a fresh download of a cached file, delete it.)

   - Run 'python rank.py anonbib.cfg' to download Google Scholar rankings of
     all the papers.

   - Run 'python writeHTML.py anonbib.cfg'.  Fix any errors you care about.

   - Re-run these scripts when you change the bibliography.

   - If you want to merge in big BibTeX files, try using the reconcile.py
     script.  See the comment at the start of the file for usage info.


New in 0.3:
   - Support for Google Scholar rankings to denote hot/rising papers.
     Implemented by George Danezis.
   - Make reconcile script generate more useful output.
   - Add support for multiple bibliographies generated from a single bibtex
     source.  This is done via 'tags' on bibtex entries.  If an entry is
     tagged, it appears in the corresponding bibliographies.  This is good
     for generating a master bibliography and one or more selected readings
     lists from the same source.
   - Handle more errors when downloading files.
   - When fetching a paper with a .ps url, generate the .ps.gz file
     automatically.
   - Note an error when a crossref overrides an existing field in an entry.
   - Handle the Proceedings type correctly.
   - Enforce proper encoding on pages: it must be number--number.
