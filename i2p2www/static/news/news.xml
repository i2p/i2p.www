<h3>2012-12-17: <b>0.9.4 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.4.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>0.9.4 includes a fix for a network capacity bug, introduced in 0.9.2,
 that was reducing network performance and reliability. It also includes
 major changes in the in-network update system, and adds the capability
 to update via in-network torrents. </p>

<p>We fixed several bugs in the i2psnark DHT implementation that was introduced
 last release. For those of you using console or http proxy passwords,
 we converted to the more-secure digest method and improved the security for console forms.</p>

<p>For those of you already running development builds, your router should automatically
update to 0.9.4-0 using the new in-network torrent facility.
For those running 0.9.3-0, you will update normally using in-network HTTP, and
we will have more information for you when we release 0.9.5.</p>

<p>
As usual, there's also lots of bug fixes in this release, so updating is recommended.
