<h3>2014-08-09: <b>0.9.14.1 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2014/08/09/0.9.14.1-Release">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
0.9.14.1 includes fixes for the "Add Torrent" form in i2psnark and some other web forms.
We've restored the ability to install plugins via the console, but you must first edit your router.config file
(in <tt>~/.i2p/</tt> or <tt>/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/</tt> or <tt>%APPDATA%\I2P\</tt>) to add the line <tt>routerconsole.enablePluginInstall=true</tt>.
Other rarely-used advanced features that were removed in 0.9.14 may be restored by adding the line <tt>routerconsole.advanced=true</tt>.
</p><p>
As usual, if configured with the default "Download and Verify", the router will automatically download the update and display a button to restart.
However, due to a bug in 0.9.14, if your update is configured for "Notify only", the download button will not be displayed.
You must change your configuration to "Download and Verify" or "Download, Verify, and Restart" to update.
</p><p>
Thanks to everybody for updating so quickly for the security fixes in 0.9.14; we set records for update downloads.
If you are still running 0.9.13 or older, we recommend that you update to this release as soon as possible.
If you don't often check your router console, please consider changing your configuration to "Download, Verify, and Restart"
to ensure you are always running the latest release.
