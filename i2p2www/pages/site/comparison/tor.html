<h2>Tor / Onion Routing</h2>

Tor and Onion Routing are both anonymizing proxy networks, 
allowing people to tunnel out through their low latency mix 
network. The two primary differences between Tor / 
Onion-Routing and I2P are again related to differences in 
the threat model and the out-proxy design (though Tor
supports hidden services as well).  In addition, Tor
takes the directory-based approach - providing a 
centralized point to manage the overall 'view' of the 
network, as well as gather and report statistics, as 
opposed to I2P's distributed <a href="{{ netdb }}">network 
database</a> and <a href="{{ peerselection }}">peer selection</a>.

<p>{% trans -%}
The I2P/Tor outproxy functionality does have a few 
substantial weaknesses against certain attackers - 
once the communication leaves the mixnet, global passive
adversaries can more easily mount traffic analysis.  In 
addition, the outproxies have access to the cleartext 
of the data transferred in both directions, and 
outproxies are prone to abuse, along with all of the 
other security issues we've come to know and love with 
normal Internet traffic.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
However, many people don't need to worry about those 
situations, as they are outside their threat model.  It
is, also, outside I2P's (formal) functional scope (if people want
to build outproxy functionality on top of an anonymous
communication layer, they can).  In fact, some I2P users
currently take advantage of Tor to outproxy.

{% trans -%}
Much bigger user base; much more visibility in the academic and hacker communities; benefits from

Unidirectional tunnels instead of bidirectional
circuits, doubling the number of nodes a peer has to
compromise to get the same information.
{%- endtrans %}

 <li>
{% trans -%}
Protection against detecting client activity, even
when an attacker is participating in the tunnel, as
tunnels are used for more than simply passing end 
to end messages (e.g. netDb, tunnel management, 
tunnel testing)
{%- endtrans %}
 </li>
 <li>
{% trans -%}
Tunnels in I2P are short lived, decreasing the number
of samples that an attacker can use to mount an 
active attack with, unlike circuits in Tor, which are
typically long lived.

security, while SOCKS is designed for functionality.

bandwidth, they don't fully participate in the mixnet.
