  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P is a scalable, self organizing, resilient packet switched anonymous 
network layer, upon which any number of different anonymity or security conscious 
applications can operate. Each of these applications may make their own anonymity, 
latency, and throughput tradeoffs without worrying about the proper implementation 
of a free route mixnet, allowing them to blend their activity with the larger 
anonymity set of users already running on top of I2P.

Applications available already provide the full range of typical Internet activities -
<b>anonymous</b> web browsing, web hosting, chat, file sharing, e-mail,
blogging and content syndication, as well as several other applications under development.

Unlike web sites hosted within content distribution networks like <a href="#similar.freenet">Freenet</a> 
or <a href="https://www.gnunet.org/en/">GNUnet</a>, the services hosted on 
I2P are fully interactive - there are traditional web-style search engines, 
bulletin boards, blogs you can comment on, database driven sites, and bridges 
to query static systems like Freenet without needing to install it locally. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
With all of these anonymity enabled applications, I2P takes on the role 
of the message oriented middleware - applications say that they want to send 
some data to a cryptographic identifier (a "destination") and I2P takes care 
of making sure it gets there securely and anonymously. I2P also bundles a 
simple <a href="#app.streaming">streaming</a> library to allow I2P's anonymous 
best-effort messages to transfer as reliable, in-order streams, transparently 
offering a TCP based congestion control algorithm tuned for the high bandwidth 
delay product of the network. While there have been several simple SOCKS proxies 
available to tie existing applications into the network, their value has been 
limited as nearly every application routinely exposes what, in an anonymous 
context, is sensitive information. The only safe way to go is to fully audit 
an application to ensure proper operation and to assist in that we provide 
a series of APIs in various languages which can be used to make the most out 
of the network.

I2P is not a research project - academic, commercial, or governmental, but 
is instead an engineering effort aimed at doing whatever is necessary to provide 
a sufficient level of anonymity to those who need it. It has been in active 
development since early 2003 with one full time developer and a dedicated 
group of part time contributors from all over the world. All of the work done 
on I2P is open source and freely available on the <a href="{{ site }}">website</a>, 
with the majority of the code released outright into the public domain, though 
making use of a few cryptographic routines under BSD-style licenses. The people 
working on I2P do not control what people release client applications under, 
and there are several GPL'ed applications available (<a href="#app.i2ptunnel">I2PTunnel</a>,

  <h1 id="op">{% trans %}Operation{% endtrans %}</h1>
  <h2 id="op.overview">{% trans %}Overview{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans -%}
To understand I2P's operation, it is essential to understand a few key concepts. 
First, I2P makes a strict separation between the software participating in 
the network (a "router") and the anonymous endpoints ("destinations") associated 
with individual applications. The fact that someone is running I2P is not 
usually a secret. What is hidden is information on what the user is doing, 
if anything at all, as well as what router a particular destination is connected 
to. End users will typically have several local destinations on their router 
- for instance, one proxying in to IRC servers, another supporting the user's 
anonymous webserver ("I2P Site"), another for an I2Phex instance, another for 
torrents, etc.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Another critical concept to understand is the "tunnel".
A tunnel is a directed path through an explicitly selected list of routers.
Layered encryption is used, so each of the routers can only decrypt a single layer.
The decrypted information contains the IP of the next router, along with
the encrypted information to be forwarded.
Each tunnel has a starting point (the first router, also known as "gateway")
and an end point. Messages can be sent only in one way. To send messages back,
another tunnel is required.

      <br /><br />
      {% trans %}Figure 1: Two types of tunnels exist: inbound and outbound.{% endtrans %}
    </div>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Two types of tunnels exist:
<b>"outbound" tunnels</b> send messages away from the tunnel creator,
while <b>"inbound" tunnels</b> bring messages to the tunnel creator.
Combining these two tunnels allows users to send messages to each other.
The sender ("Alice" in the above image) sets up an outbound tunnel,
while the receiver ("Bob" in the above image) creates an inbound tunnel.
The gateway of an inbound tunnel can receive messages from any other user
and will send them on until the endpoint ("Bob").
The endpoint of the outbound tunnel will need to send the message
on to the gateway of the inbound tunnel.
To do this, the sender ("Alice") adds instructions to her encrypted message.
Once the endpoint of the outbound tunnel decrypts the message,
it will have instructions to forward the message to the correct
inbound gateway (the gateway to "Bob").
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
A third critical concept to understand is I2P's <b>"network database"</b> (or "netDb") 
- a pair of algorithms used to share network metadata. The two types of metadata 
carried are <b>"routerInfo"</b> and <b>"leaseSets"</b> - the routerInfo gives routers the 
data necessary for contacting a particular router (their public keys, transport 
addresses, etc), while the leaseSet gives routers the information necessary 
for contacting a particular destination. A leaseSet contains a number of "leases".
Each of this leases specifies a tunnel gateway, which allows reaching a specific destination.
The full information contained in a lease:

      <li>{% trans %}Time when a tunnel expires.{% endtrans %}</li>
      <li>{% trans %}Pair of public keys to be able to encrypt messages (to send through the tunnel and reach the destination).{% endtrans %}</li>
    </ul>
  <p>{% trans -%}
Routers themselves send their routerInfo to the netDb directly, while leaseSets are sent through outbound tunnels
(leaseSets need to be sent anonymously, to avoid correlating a router with his leaseSets).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
We can combine the above concepts to build successful connections in the network.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
To build up her own inbound and outbound tunnels, Alice does a lookup in the netDb to collect routerInfo.
This way, she gathers lists of peers she can use as hops in her tunnels.
She can then send a build message to the first hop, requesting the construction of a tunnel and asking
that router to send the construction message onward, until the tunnel has been constructed.

      {% trans %}Figure 2: Router information is used to build tunnels.{% endtrans %}
    </div>
  <br/>
  <p>{% trans -%}
When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she first does a lookup in the 
netDb to find Bob's leaseSet, giving her his current inbound tunnel gateways. 
She then picks one of her outbound tunnels and sends the message down it with 
instructions for the outbound tunnel's endpoint to forward the message on 
to one of Bob's inbound tunnel gateways. When the outbound tunnel endpoint 
receives those instructions, it forwards the message as requested, and when 
Bob's inbound tunnel gateway receives it, it is forwarded down the tunnel 
to Bob's router. If Alice wants Bob to be able to reply to the message, she 
needs to transmit her own destination explicitly as part of the message itself.
This can be done by introducing a higher-level layer, which is done in the
<a href="#app.streaming">streaming</a> library.
Alice may also cut down on the response time by bundling her most 
recent LeaseSet with the message so that Bob doesn't need to do a netDb lookup 
for it when he wants to reply, but this is optional.

      <br /><br />
      {% trans %}Figure 3: LeaseSets are used to connect outbound and inbound tunnels.{% endtrans %}
    </div>
  <br/>
  <p>{% trans -%}
While the tunnels themselves have layered encryption to prevent unauthorized 
disclosure to peers inside the network (as the transport layer itself does 
to prevent unauthorized disclosure to peers outside the network), it is necessary 
to add an additional end to end layer of encryption to hide the message from 
the outbound tunnel endpoint and the inbound tunnel gateway. This "<a href="#op.garlic">garlic 
encryption</a>" lets Alice's router wrap up multiple messages into a single 
"garlic message", encrypted to a particular public key so that intermediary 
peers cannot determine either how many messages are within the garlic, what 
those messages say, or where those individual cloves are destined. For typical 
end to end communication between Alice and Bob, the garlic will be encrypted 
to the public key published in Bob's leaseSet, allowing the message to be 
encrypted without giving out the public key to Bob's own router.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Another important fact to keep in mind is that I2P is entirely message based 
and that some messages may be lost along the way. Applications using I2P can 
use the message oriented interfaces and take care of their own congestion 
control and reliability needs, but most would be best served by reusing the 
provided <a href="#app.streaming">streaming</a> library to view I2P as a streams 
based network.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="op.tunnels">{% trans %}Tunnels{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans -%}
Both inbound and outbound tunnels work along similar principles.
The tunnel gateway accumulates a number of tunnel messages, eventually preprocessing 
them into something for tunnel delivery. Next, the gateway encrypts that preprocessed 
data and forwards it to the first hop. That peer and subsequent tunnel participants 
add on a layer of encryption after verifying that it isn't a duplicate before 
forward it on to the next peer. Eventually, the message arrives at the endpoint 
where the messages are split out again and forwarded on as requested. The 
difference arises in what the tunnel's creator does - for inbound tunnels, 
the creator is the endpoint and they simply decrypt all of the layers added, 
while for outbound tunnels, the creator is the gateway and they pre-decrypt 
all of the layers so that after all of the layers of per-hop encryption are 
added, the message arrives in the clear at the tunnel endpoint.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
The choice of specific peers to pass on messages as well as their particular 
ordering is important to understanding both I2P's anonymity and performance 
characteristics. While the network database (below) has its own criteria for 
picking what peers to query and store entries on, tunnel creators may use any peers 
in the network in any order (and even any number of times) in a single tunnel. 
If perfect latency and capacity data were globally known, selection and ordering 
would be driven by the particular needs of the client in tandem with their 
threat model. Unfortunately, latency and capacity data is not trivial to gather 
anonymously, and depending upon untrusted peers to provide this information 
has its own serious anonymity implications.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
From an anonymity perspective, the simplest technique would be to pick peers 
randomly from the entire network, order them randomly and use those peers 
in that order for all eternity. From a performance perspective, the simplest 
technique would be to pick the fastest peers with the necessary spare capacity, 
spreading the load across different peers to handle transparent failover, 
and to rebuild the tunnel whenever capacity information changes. While the 
former is both brittle and inefficient, the later requires inaccessible information 
and offers insufficient anonymity. I2P is instead working on offering a range 
of peer selection strategies, coupled with anonymity aware measurement code 
to organize the peers by their profiles.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
As a base, I2P is constantly profiling the peers with which it interacts 
with by measuring their indirect behavior - for instance, when a peer responds 
to a netDb lookup in 1.3 seconds, that round trip latency is recorded in the 
profiles for all of the routers involved in the two tunnels (inbound and outbound) 
through which the request and response passed, as well as the queried peer's 
profile. Direct measurement, such as transport layer latency or congestion, 
is not used as part of the profile, as it can be manipulated and associated 
with the measuring router, exposing them to trivial attacks. While gathering 
these profiles, a series of calculations are run on each to summarize its 
performance - its latency, capacity to handle lots of activity, whether they 
are currently overloaded, and how well integrated into the network they seem 
to be. These calculations are then compared for active peers to organize the 
routers into four tiers - fast and high capacity, high capacity, not failing, 
and failing. The thresholds for those tiers are determined dynamically, and 
while they currently use fairly simple algorithms, alternatives exist.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Using this profile data, the simplest reasonable peer selection strategy is to
pick peers randomly from the top tier (fast and high capacity), and this is
currently deployed for client tunnels. Exploratory tunnels (used for netDb and
tunnel management) pick peers randomly from the "not failing" tier (which
includes routers in 'better' tiers as well), allowing the peer to sample
routers more widely, in effect optimizing the peer selection through randomized
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill climbing</a>. These
strategies alone do however leak information regarding the peers in the
router's top tier through predecessor and netDb harvesting attacks. In turn,
several alternatives exist which, while not balancing the load as evenly, will
address the attacks mounted by particular classes of adversaries.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
By picking a random key and ordering the peers according to their XOR distance 
from it, the information leaked is reduced in predecessor and harvesting attacks 
according to the peers' failure rate and the tier's churn. Another simple 
strategy for dealing with netDb harvesting attacks is to simply fix the inbound 
tunnel gateway(s) yet randomize the peers further on in the tunnels. To deal 
with predecessor attacks for adversaries which the client contacts, the outbound 
tunnel endpoints would also remain fixed. The selection of which peer to fix 
on the most exposed point would of course need to have a limit to the duration, 
as all peers fail eventually, so it could either be reactively adjusted or 
proactively avoided to mimic a measured mean time between failures of other 
routers. These two strategies can in turn be combined, using a fixed exposed 
peer and an XOR based ordering within the tunnels themselves. A more rigid 
strategy would fix the exact peers and ordering of a potential tunnel, only 
using individual peers if all of them agree to participate in the same way 
each time. This varies from the XOR based ordering in that the predecessor 
and successor of each peer is always the same, while the XOR only makes sure 
their order doesn't change.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans tunnelimpl=site_url('docs/tunnels/implementation') -%}
As mentioned before, I2P currently (release 0.8) includes the tiered 
random strategy above, with XOR-based ordering. A 
more detailed discussion of the mechanics involved in tunnel operation, management, 
and peer selection can be found in the <a href="{{ tunnelimpl }}">tunnel spec</a>. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="op.netdb">{% trans %}Network Database{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans netdb=site_url('docs/how/network-database') -%}
As mentioned earlier, I2P's netDb works to share the network's metadata.
This is detailed in <a href="{{ netdb }}">the network database</a> page,
but a basic explanation is available below.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
All I2P routers contain a local netDb, but not all routers participate in the DHT
or respond to leaseset lookups.
Those routers that do participate in the DHT and respond to leaseset lookups
are called 'floodfills'.
Routers may be manually configured as floodfills, or automatically become floodfill
if they have enough capacity and meet other criteria for reliable operation.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans netdb=site_url('docs/how/network-database') -%}
Other I2P routers will store their data and lookup data by sending simple 'store' and 'lookup' queries to the floodfills.
If a floodfill router receives a 'store' query, it will spread the information to other floodfill routers
using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia algorithm</a>.
The 'lookup' queries currently function differently, to avoid an important
<a href="{{ netdb }}#lookup">security issue</a>.
When a lookup is done, the floodfill router will not forward the lookup to other peers,
but will always answer by itself (if it has the requested data).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Two types of information are stored in the network database.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>{% trans %}A <b>RouterInfo</b> stores information on a specific I2P router and how to contact it{% endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans %}A <b>LeaseSet</b> stores information on a specific destination (e.g. I2P website, e-mail server...){% endtrans %}</li>
    </ul>
  <p>{% trans -%}
All of this information is signed by the publishing party and verified by any I2P router using or storing the information.
In addition, the data contains timing information, to avoid storage of old entries and possible attacks.
This is also why I2P bundles the necessary code for maintaining the correct time, occasionally querying some SNTP servers 
(the <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/">pool.ntp.org</a> round robin by default)
and detecting skew between routers at the transport layer.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Some additional remarks are also important.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>{% trans %}Unpublished and encrypted leasesets:{% endtrans %}</b>
        <p>{% trans -%}
One could only want specific people to be able to reach a destination.
This is possible by not publishing the destination in the netDb. You will however have to transmit the destination by other means.
This is supported by 'encrypted leaseSets'. These leaseSets can only be decoded by people with access to the decryption key.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>{% trans %}Bootstrapping:{% endtrans %}</b>
        <p>{% trans -%}
Bootstrapping the netDb is quite simple. Once a router manages to receive a single routerInfo of a reachable peer,
it can query that router for references to other routers in the network.
Currently, a number of users post their routerInfo files to a website to make this information available.
I2P automatically connects to one of these websites to gather routerInfo files and bootstrap.
I2P calls this bootstrap process "reseeding".
{%- endtrans %}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>{% trans %}Lookup scalability:{% endtrans %}</b>
        <p>{% trans -%}
Lookups in the I2P network are iterative, not recursive.
If a lookup from a floodfill fails, the lookup will be repeated to the next-closest floodfill.
The floodfill does not recursively ask another floodfill for the data.
Iterative lookups are scalable to large DHT networks.

      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="op.transport">{% trans %}Transport protocols{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans -%}
Communication between routers needs to provide confidentiality and integrity 
against external adversaries while authenticating that the router contacted 
is the one who should receive a given message. The particulars of how routers 
communicate with other routers aren't critical - three separate protocols 
have been used at different points to provide those bare necessities.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans ntcp=site_url('docs/transport/ntcp'), ssu=site_url('docs/transport/ssu'), ntcp2=spec_url('ntcp2'), ssu2=spec_url('ssu2') -%}
I2P currently supports two transport protocols,
<a href="{{ ntcp2 }}">NTCP2</a> over TCP, and <a href="{{ ssu2 }}">SSU2</a> over UDP.
These have replaced the previous versions of the protocols,
<a href="{{ ntcp }}">NTCP</a> and <a href="{{ ssu }}">SSU</a>, which are now deprecated.
Both protocols support both IPv4 and IPv6.
By supporting both TCP and UDP transports, I2P can effectively traverse most firewalls,
including those intended to block traffic in restrictive censorship regimes.
NTCP2 and SSU2 were designed to use modern encryption standards,
improve traffic identification resistance,
increase efficiency and security,
and make NAT traversal more robust.
Routers publish each supported transport and IP address in the network database.
Routers with access to public IPv4 and IPv6 networks will usually publish
four addresses, one for each combination of NTCP2/SSU2 with IPv4/IPv6.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans ssu=site_url('docs/transport/ssu'), ssu2=spec_url('ssu2') -%}

SSU2 has many similarities to other modern UDP-based protocols such as Wireguard and QUIC.
In addition to the reliable transport of network messages over UDP,
SSU2 provides specialized facilities for peer-to-peer, cooperative
IP address detection, firewall detection, and NAT traversal.

I2P supports multiple transports simultaneously. A particular transport

an established connection to the peer.

{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="op.crypto">{% trans %}Cryptography{% endtrans %}</h2>

  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P uses cryptography at several protocol layers for encryption, authentication, and verification.
The major protocol layers are: transports, tunnel build messages, tunnel layer encryption,
network database messages, and end-to-end (garlic) messages.
I2P's original design used a small set of cryptographic primitives that at the time were considered secure.
These included ElGamal asymmetric encryption, DSA-SHA1 signatures,
AES256/CBC symmetric encryption, and SHA-256 hashes.
As available computing power increased and cryptographic research evolved substantially
over the years, I2P needed to upgrade its primitives and protocols.
Therefore, we added a concept of "encryption types" and "signature types",
and extended our protocols to include these identifiers and indicate support.
This allows us to periodically update and extend the network support for
modern cryptography and future-proof the network for new primitives,
without breaking backward compatibility or requiring a "flag day" for network updates.
Some signature and encryption types are also reserved for experimental use.

  <h3 id="op.garlic">{% trans %}Garlic messages{% endtrans %}</h3>
  <p>{% trans -%}
Garlic messages are an extension of "onion" layered encryption, allowing 
the contents of a single message to contain multiple "cloves" - fully formed 
messages alongside their own instructions for delivery. Messages are wrapped 
into a garlic message whenever the message would otherwise be passing in cleartext 
through a peer who should not have access to the information - for instance, 
when a router wants to ask another router to participate in a tunnel, they 
wrap the request inside a garlic, encrypt that garlic to the receiving router's 
public key, and forward it through a tunnel. Another example 
is when a client wants to send a message to a destination - the sender's router 
will wrap up that data message (alongside some other messages) into a garlic, 
encrypt that garlic to the public key published in the recipient's 
leaseSet, and forward it through the appropriate tunnels.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
The "instructions" attached to each clove inside the encryption layer includes 
the ability to request that the clove be forwarded locally, to a remote router, 
or to a remote tunnel on a remote router. There are fields in those instructions 
allowing a peer to request that the delivery be delayed until a certain time 
or condition has been met, though they won't be honored until the <a href="#future.variablelatency">nontrivial 
delays</a> are deployed. It is possible to explicitly route garlic messages 
any number of hops without building tunnels, or even to reroute tunnel messages 
by wrapping them in garlic messages and forwarding them a number of hops prior 
to delivering them to the next hop in the tunnel, but those techniques are 
not currently used in the existing implementation.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h3 id="op.sessiontags">{% trans %}Session tags{% endtrans %}</h3>
  <p>{% trans -%}
As an unreliable, unordered, message based system, I2P uses a simple combination 
of asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms to provide data confidentiality 
and integrity to garlic messages. The original combination was referred 
to as ElGamal/AES+SessionTags, but that is an excessively verbose way to describe 
the simple use of 2048bit ElGamal, AES256, SHA256 and 32 byte nonces.
While this protocol is still supported, most of the network has migrated to
a new protocol, ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet.
This protocol combines X25519, ChaCha20/Poly1305, and a synchronized PRNG
to generate the 32 byte nonces.
Both protocols will be briefly described below.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h4 id="op.elg">ElGamal/AES+SessionTags</h4>
  <p>{% trans -%}
The first time a router wants to encrypt a garlic message to another router, 
they encrypt the keying material for an AES256 session key with ElGamal and 
append the AES256/CBC encrypted payload after that encrypted ElGamal block. 
In addition to the encrypted payload, the AES encrypted section contains the 
payload length, the SHA256 hash of the unencrypted payload, as well as a number 
of "session tags" - random 32 byte nonces. The next time the sender wants 
to encrypt a garlic message to another router, rather than ElGamal encrypt 
a new session key they simply pick one of the previously delivered session 
tags and AES encrypt the payload like before, using the session key used with 
that session tag, prepended with the session tag itself. When a router receives 
a garlic encrypted message, they check the first 32 bytes to see if it matches 
an available session tag - if it does, they simply AES decrypt the message, 
but if it does not, they ElGamal decrypt the first block.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Each session tag can be used only once so as to prevent internal adversaries 
from unnecessarily correlating different messages as being between the same 
routers. The sender of an ElGamal/AES+SessionTag encrypted message chooses 
when and how many tags to deliver, prestocking the recipient with enough tags 
to cover a volley of messages. Garlic messages may detect the successful tag 
delivery by bundling a small additional message as a clove (a "delivery status 
message") - when the garlic message arrives at the intended recipient and 
is decrypted successfully, this small delivery status message is one of the 
cloves exposed and has instructions for the recipient to send the clove back 
to the original sender (through an inbound tunnel, of course). When the original 
sender receives this delivery status message, they know that the session tags 
bundled in the garlic message were successfully delivered.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Session tags themselves have a very short lifetime, after which they are 
discarded if not used. In addition, the quantity stored for each key is limited, 
as are the number of keys themselves - if too many arrive, either new or old 
messages may be dropped. The sender keeps track whether messages using session 
tags are getting through, and if there isn't sufficient communication it may 
drop the ones previously assumed to be properly delivered, reverting back 
to the full expensive ElGamal encryption.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h4 id="op.ratchet">ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet</h4>
  <p>{% trans -%}
ElGamal/AES+SessionTags required substantial overhead in a number of ways.
CPU usage was high because ElGamal is quite slow.
Bandwidth was excessive because large numbers of session tags had to be delivered in advance,
and because ElGamal public keys are very large.
Memory usage was high due to the requirement to store large amounts of session tags.
Reliability was hampered by lost session tag delivery.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet was designed to address these issues.
X25519 is used for key exchange.
ChaCha20/Poly1305 is used for authenticated symmetric encryption.
Encryption keys are "double ratcheted" or rotated periodically.
Session tags are reduced from 32 bytes to 8 bytes and are generated with a PRNG.
The protocol has many similarities to the signal protocol used in Signal and WhatsApp.
This protocol provides substantially lower overhead in CPU, RAM, and bandwidth.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
The session tags are generated from a deterministic synchronized PRNG running
at both ends of the session to generate session tags and session keys.
The PRNG is a HKDF using a SHA-256 HMAC, and is seeded from the X25519 DH result.
Session tags are never transmitted in advance; they are only included with the message.
The receiver stores a limited number of session keys, indexed by session tag.
The sender does not need to store any session tags or keys because they
are not sent in advance; they may be generated on-demand.
By keeping 
this PRNG roughly synchronized between the sender and recipient (the recipient 
precomputes a window of the next e.g. 50 tags), the overhead of periodically 
bundling a large number of tags is removed.

  <h1 id="future">{% trans %}Future{% endtrans %}</h1>
  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P's protocols are efficient on most platforms, including cell phones,
and secure for most threat models. However, there
are several areas which require further improvement to meet the needs of those 
facing powerful state-sponsored adversaries, and to meet the threats of
continued cryptographic advances and ever-increasing computing power.
Two possible features, restricted routes and variable latency,
were propsed by jrandom in 2003. While we no longer plan to
implement these features, they are described below.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="future.restricted">{% trans %}Restricted route operation{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P is an overlay network designed to be run on top of a functional packet 
switched network, exploiting the end to end principle to offer anonymity and 
security. While the Internet no longer fully embraces the end to end principle
(due to the usage of NAT), 
I2P does require a substantial portion of the network to be reachable - there 
may be a number of peers along the edges running using restricted routes, 
but I2P does not include an appropriate routing algorithm for the degenerate 
case where most peers are unreachable. It would, however work on top of a 
network employing such an algorithm.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Restricted route operation, where there are limits to what peers are reachable 
directly, has several different functional and anonymity implications, dependent 
upon how the restricted routes are handled. At the most basic level, restricted 
routes exist when a peer is behind a NAT or firewall which does not allow 
inbound connections. This was largely addressed by integrating 
distributed hole punching into the transport layer, allowing people behind 
most NATs and firewalls to receive unsolicited connections without any configuration. 
However, this does not limit the exposure of the peer's IP address to routers 
inside the network, as they can simply get introduced to the peer through 
the published introducer.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Beyond the functional handling of restricted routes, there are two levels 
of restricted operation that can be used to limit the exposure of one's IP 
address - using router-specific tunnels for communication, and offering 'client 
routers'. For the former, routers can either build a new pool of tunnels or 
reuse their exploratory pool, publishing the inbound gateways to some of them 
as part of their routerInfo in place of their transport addresses. When a 
peer wants to get in touch with them, they see those tunnel gateways in the 
netDb and simply send the relevant message to them through one of the published 
tunnels. If the peer behind the restricted route wants to reply, it may do 
so either directly (if they are willing to expose their IP to the peer) or 
indirectly through their outbound tunnels. When the routers that the peer 
has direct connections to want to reach it (to forward tunnel messages, for 
instance), they simply prioritize their direct connection over the published 
tunnel gateway. The concept of 'client routers' simply extends the restricted 
route by not publishing any router addresses. Such a router would not even 
need to publish their routerInfo in the netDb, merely providing their self 
signed routerInfo to the peers that it contacts (necessary to pass the router's 
public keys).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
There are tradeoffs for those behind restricted routes, as they would likely 
participate in other people's tunnels less frequently, and the routers which 
they are connected to would be able to infer traffic patterns that would not 
otherwise be exposed. On the other hand, if the cost of that exposure is less 
than the cost of an IP being made available, it may be worthwhile. This, of 
course, assumes that the peers that the router behind a restricted route contacts 
are not hostile - either the network is large enough that the probability 
of using a hostile peer to get connected is small enough, or trusted (and 
perhaps temporary) peers are used instead.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Restricted routes are complex, and the overall goal has been largely abandoned.
Several related improvements have greatly reduced the need for them.
We now support UPnP to automatically open firewall ports.
We support both IPv4 and IPv6.
SSU2 improved address detection, firewall state determination, and cooperative NAT hole punching.
SSU2, NTCP2, and address compatibility checks ensure that tunnel hops can connect
before the tunnel is built.
GeoIP and country identification allow us to avoid peers in countries with restrictive firewalls.
Support for "hidden" routers behind those firewalls has improved.
Some implementations also support connections to peers on overlay networks such as Yggdrasil.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


  <h2 id="future.variablelatency">{% trans %}Variable latency{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans -%}
Even though the bulk of I2P's initial efforts have been on low latency communication, 
it was designed with variable latency services in mind from the beginning. 
At the most basic level, applications running on top of I2P can offer the 
anonymity of medium and high latency communication while still blending their 
traffic patterns in with low latency traffic. Internally though, I2P can offer 
its own medium and high latency communication through the garlic encryption 
- specifying that the message should be sent after a certain delay, at a certain 
time, after a certain number of messages have passed, or another mix strategy. 
With the layered encryption, only the router that the clove exposed the delay 
request would know that the message requires high latency, allowing the traffic 
to blend in further with the low latency traffic. Once the transmission precondition 
is met, the router holding on to the clove (which itself would likely be a 
garlic message) simply forwards it as requested - to a router, to a tunnel, 
or, most likely, to a remote client destination.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
The goal of variable latency services requires substantial resources
for store-and-forward mechanisms to support it.
These mechanisms can and are supported in various messaging applications,
such as i2p-bote.
At the network level, alternative networks such as Freenet provide these services.
We have decided not to pursue this goal at the I2P router level.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


  <h1 id="similar">{% trans %}Similar systems{% endtrans %}</h1>

  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P's architecture builds on the concepts of message oriented middleware, 
the topology of DHTs, the anonymity and cryptography of free route mixnets, 
and the adaptability of packet switched networking. The value comes not from 
novel concepts of algorithms though, but from careful engineering combining 
the research results of existing systems and papers. While there are a few 
similar efforts worth reviewing, both for technical and functional comparisons, 
two in particular are pulled out here - Tor and Freenet.

  <h2 id="similar.tor">Tor</h2>
  <p><i><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">{% trans %}website{% endtrans %}</a></i></p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
At first glance, Tor and I2P have many functional and anonymity related 
similarities. While I2P's development began before we were aware of the early 
stage efforts on Tor, many of the lessons of the original onion routing and 
ZKS efforts were integrated into I2P's design. Rather than building an essentially 
trusted, centralized system with directory servers, I2P has a self organizing 
network database with each peer taking on the responsibility of profiling 
other routers to determine how best to exploit available resources. Another 
key difference is that while both I2P and Tor use layered and ordered paths 
(tunnels and circuits/streams), I2P is fundamentally a packet switched network, 
while Tor is fundamentally a circuit switched one, allowing I2P to transparently 
route around congestion or other network failures, operate redundant pathways, 
and load balance the data across available resources. While Tor offers the 
useful outproxy functionality by offering integrated outproxy discovery and 
selection, I2P leaves such application layer decisions up to applications 
running on top of I2P - in fact, I2P has even externalized the TCP-like streaming 
library itself to the application layer, allowing developers to experiment 
with different strategies, exploiting their domain specific knowledge to offer 
better performance.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
From an anonymity perspective, there is much similarity when the core networks 
are compared. However, there are a few key differences. When dealing with 
an internal adversary or most external adversaries, I2P's simplex tunnels 
expose half as much traffic data than would be exposed with Tor's duplex circuits 
by simply looking at the flows themselves - an HTTP request and response would 
follow the same path in Tor, while in I2P the packets making up the request 
would go out through one or more outbound tunnels and the packets making up 
the response would come back through one or more different inbound tunnels. 
While I2P's peer selection and ordering strategies should sufficiently address 
predecessor attacks, should a switch to bidirectional tunnels be necessary,
we could simply build an inbound and outbound tunnel along the same routers.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Another anonymity issue comes up in Tor's use of telescopic tunnel creation, 
as simple packet counting and timing measurements as the cells in a circuit 
pass through an adversary's node exposes statistical information regarding 
where the adversary is within the circuit. I2P's unidirectional tunnel creation 
with a single message so that this data is not exposed. Protecting the position 
in a tunnel is important, as an adversary would otherwise be able to mount 
a series of powerful predecessor, intersection, and traffic confirmation attacks. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>


  <p>{% trans -%}
On the whole, Tor and I2P complement each other in their focus - Tor works 
towards offering high speed anonymous Internet outproxying, while I2P works 
towards offering a decentralized resilient network in itself. In theory, both 
can be used to achieve both purposes, but given limited development resources, 
they both have their strengths and weaknesses. The I2P developers have considered 
the steps necessary to modify Tor to take advantage of I2P's design, but concerns 
of Tor's viability under resource scarcity suggest that I2P's packet switching 
architecture will be able to exploit scarce resources more effectively.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="similar.freenet">Freenet</h2>
  <p><i><a href="http://www.freenetproject.org/">{% trans %}website{% endtrans %}</a></i></p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Freenet played a large part in the initial stages of I2P's design - giving 
proof to the viability of a vibrant pseudonymous community completely contained 
within the network, demonstrating that the dangers inherent in outproxies 
could be avoided. The first seed of I2P began as a replacement communication 
layer for Freenet, attempting to factor out the complexities of a scalable, 
anonymous and secure point to point communication from the complexities of 
a censorship resistant distributed data store. Over time however, some of 
the anonymity and scalability issues inherent in Freenet's algorithms made 
it clear that I2P's focus should stay strictly on providing a generic anonymous 
communication layer, rather than as a component of Freenet. Over the years, 
the Freenet developers have come to see the weaknesses in the older design, 
prompting them to suggest that they will require a "premix" layer to offer 
substantial anonymity. In other words, Freenet needs to run on top of a mixnet 
such as I2P or Tor, with "client nodes" requesting and publishing data through 
the mixnet to the "server nodes" which then fetch and store the data according 
to Freenet's heuristic distributed data storage algorithms.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Freenet's functionality is very complementary to I2P's, as Freenet natively 
provides many of the tools for operating medium and high latency systems, 
while I2P natively provides the low latency mix network suitable for offering 
adequate anonymity. The logic of separating the mixnet from the censorship-
resistant distributed data store still seems self-evident from an engineering, 
anonymity, security, and resource allocation perspective, so hopefully the 
Freenet team will pursue efforts in that direction, if not simply reusing 
(or helping to improve, as necessary) existing mixnets like I2P or Tor.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


  <h1 id="app">Appendix A: Application layer</h1>
  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P itself doesn't really do much - it simply sends messages to remote destinations 
and receives messages targeting local destinations - most of the interesting 
work goes on at the layers above it. By itself, I2P could be seen as an anonymous 
and secure IP layer, and the bundled <a href="#app.streaming">streaming library</a> 
as an implementation of an anonymous and secure TCP layer on top of it. Beyond 
that, <a href="#app.i2ptunnel">I2PTunnel</a> exposes a generic TCP proxying 
system for either getting into or out of the I2P network, plus a variety of 
network applications provide further functionality for end users.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="app.streaming">{% trans %}Streaming library{% endtrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% trans -%}
The I2P streaming library can be viewed as a generic streaming interface (mirroring TCP sockets),
and the implementation supports a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_Window_Protocol">sliding window protocol</a>
with several optimizations, to take into account the high delay over I2P.
Individual streams may adjust the maximum packet size and 
other options, though the default of 4KB compressed seems a reasonable tradeoff 
between the bandwidth costs of retransmitting lost messages and the latency 
of multiple messages.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
In addition, in consideration of the relatively high cost of subsequent 
messages, the streaming library's protocol for scheduling and delivering messages 
has been optimized to allow individual messages passed to contain as much 
information as is available. For instance, a small HTTP transaction proxied 
through the streaming library can be completed in a single round trip - the 
first message bundles a SYN, FIN and the small payload (an HTTP request typically 
fits) and the reply bundles the SYN, FIN, ACK and the small payload (many 
HTTP responses fit). While an additional ACK must be transmitted to tell the 
HTTP server that the SYN/FIN/ACK has been received, the local HTTP proxy can 
deliver the full response to the browser immediately.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
On the whole, however, the streaming library bears much resemblance to an 
abstraction of TCP, with its sliding windows, congestion control algorithms 
(both slow start and congestion avoidance), and general packet behavior (ACK, 
SYN, FIN, RST, etc).

  <p>{% trans -%}
Naming within I2P has been an oft-debated topic since the very beginning 
with advocates across the spectrum of possibilities. However, given I2P's 
inherent demand for secure communication and decentralized operation, the 
traditional DNS-style naming system is clearly out, as are "majority rules" 
voting systems. Instead, I2P ships with a generic naming library and a base 
implementation designed to work off a local name to destination mapping, as 
well as an optional add-on application called the "Address Book". The address book 
is a web-of-trust-driven secure, distributed, and human readable naming system, 
sacrificing only the call for all human readable names to be globally unique 
by mandating only local uniqueness. While all messages in I2P are cryptographically 
addressed by their destination, different people can have local address book 
entries for "Alice" which refer to different destinations. People can still 
discover new names by importing published address books of peers specified 
in their web of trust, by adding in the entries provided through a third party, 
or (if some people organize a series of published address books using a first 
come first serve registration system) people can choose to treat these address books 
as name servers, emulating traditional DNS.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P does not promote the use of DNS-like services though, as the damage 
done by hijacking a site can be tremendous - and insecure destinations have 
no value. DNSsec itself still falls back on registrars and certificate authorities, 
while with I2P, requests sent to a destination cannot be intercepted or the 
reply spoofed, as they are encrypted to the destination's public keys, and 
a destination itself is just a pair of public keys and a certificate. DNS-style 
systems on the other hand allow any of the name servers on the lookup path 
to mount simple denial of service and spoofing attacks. Adding on a certificate 
authenticating the responses as signed by some centralized certificate authority 
would address many of the hostile nameserver issues but would leave open replay 
attacks as well as hostile certificate authority attacks.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
Voting style naming is dangerous as well, especially given the effectiveness 
of Sybil attacks in anonymous systems - the attacker can simply create an 
arbitrarily high number of peers and "vote" with each to take over a given 
name. Proof-of-work methods can be used to make identity non-free, but as 
the network grows the load required to contact everyone to conduct online 
voting is implausible, or if the full network is not queried, different sets 
of answers may be reachable.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
As with the Internet however, I2P is keeping the design and operation of 
a naming system out of the (IP-like) communication layer. The bundled naming 
library includes a simple service provider interface which alternate naming 
systems can plug into, allowing end users to drive what sort of naming tradeoffs 
they prefer.

  <p>{% trans -%}
I2PTunnel is probably I2P's most popular and versatile client application, 
allowing generic proxying both into and out of the I2P network. I2PTunnel 
can be viewed as four separate proxying applications - a "client" which receives 
inbound TCP connections and forwards them to a given I2P destination, an "httpclient" 
(aka "eepproxy") which acts like an HTTP proxy and forwards the requests to 
the appropriate I2P destination (after querying the naming service if necessary), 
a "server" which receives inbound I2P streaming connections on a destination 
and forwards them to a given TCP host+port, and an "httpserver" which extends 
the "server" by parsing the HTTP request and responses to allow safer operation. 
There is an additional "socksclient" application, but its use is not encouraged 
for reasons previously mentioned.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans -%}
I2P itself is not an outproxy network - the anonymity and security concerns 
inherent in a mix net which forwards data into and out of the mix have kept 
I2P's design focused on providing an anonymous network which capable of meeting 
the user's needs without requiring external resources. However, the I2PTunnel 
"httpclient" application offers a hook for outproxying - if the hostname requested 
doesn't end in ".i2p", it picks a random destination from a user-provided 
set of outproxies and forwards the request to them. These destinations are 
simply I2PTunnel "server" instances run by volunteers who have explicitly 
chosen to run outproxies - no one is an outproxy by default, and running an 
outproxy doesn't automatically tell other people to proxy through you. While 
outproxies do have inherent weaknesses, they offer a simple proof of concept 
for using I2P and provide some functionality under a threat model which may 
be sufficient for some users.

I2PTunnel enables most of the applications in use. An "httpserver" pointing 
at a webserver lets anyone run their own anonymous website (or "I2P Site") 
- a webserver is bundled with I2P for this purpose, but any webserver can 
be used. Anyone may run a "client" pointing at one of the anonymously hosted 
IRC servers, each of which are running a "server" pointing at their local 
IRCd and communicating between IRCds over their own "client" tunnels. End 
users also have "client" tunnels pointing at <a href="#app.i2pmail">I2Pmail's</a> 
POP3 and SMTP destinations (which in turn are simply "server" instances pointing 
at POP3 and SMTP servers), as well as "client" tunnels pointing at I2P's CVS 
server, allowing anonymous development. At times people have even run "client" 
proxies to access the "server" instances pointing at an NNTP server.
