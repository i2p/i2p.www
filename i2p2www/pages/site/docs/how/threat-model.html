<h2>{% trans %}What do we mean by "anonymous"?{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Your level of anonymity can be described as "how hard it is for someone
to find out information you don't want them to know?" - who you are, where
you are located, who you communicate with, or even when you communicate.  
"Perfect" anonymity is not a useful concept here - software will not make 
you indistinguishable from people that don't use computers or who are not on
the Internet.  Instead, we are working to provide sufficient anonymity to meet the
real needs of whomever we can - from those simply browsing websites, to those exchanging
data, to those fearful of discovery by powerful organizations or states.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
  
<p>{% trans -%}
The question of whether I2P provides sufficient anonymity for your 
particular needs is a hard one, but this page will hopefully assist in 
answering that question by exploring how I2P operates under various attacks
so that you may decide whether it meets your needs.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
We welcome further research and analysis on I2P's resistance to the threats described below.
More review of existing literature (much of it focused on Tor) and original
work focused on I2P is needed.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans %}Network Topology Summary{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans comparisons=site_url('comparison'), links=site_url('links') -%}
I2P builds off the ideas of many <a href="{{ comparisons }}">other</a> 
<a href="{{ links }}">systems</a>, but a few key points should be kept in mind when 
reviewing related literature:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<ul>
<li>{% trans -%}
<b>I2P is a free route mixnet</b> - the message creator explicitly defines the
path that messages will be sent out (the outbound tunnel), and the message 
recipient explicitly defines the path that messages will be received on (the
inbound tunnel).
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
<b>I2P has no official entry and exit points</b> - all peers fully participate in the 
mix, and there are no network layer in- or out-proxies (however, at the 
application layer, a few proxies do exist)
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
<b>I2P is fully distributed</b> - there are no central controls or authorities.
One could modify some routers to operate mix cascades (building tunnels and giving
out the keys necessary to control the forwarding at the tunnel endpoint) or directory 
based profiling and selection, all without breaking compatibility with the rest of 
the network, but doing so is of course not necessary (and may even harm one's
anonymity).
{%- endtrans %}</li>
</ul>

<p>{% trans todo=site_url('get-involved/todo') -%}
We have documented plans to implement <a href="{{ todo }}#stop">nontrivial delays</a>
and <a href="{{ todo }}#batching">batching strategies</a> 
whose existence is only known to the particular hop or tunnel gateway that 
receives the message, allowing a mostly low latency mixnet to provide cover 
traffic for higher latency communication (e.g. email).
However we are aware that significant delays are required to provide meaningful
protection, and that implementation of such delays will be a significant challenge.
It is not clear at this time whether we will actually implement these delay features.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
In theory, routers along the message path may inject an 
arbitrary number of hops before forwarding the message to the next peer, though
the current implementation does not.

<h2>{% trans %}The Threat Model{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P design started in 2003, not long after the advent of

<a href="http://freenetproject.org/">[Freenet]</a>, and
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">[Tor]</a>.
Our design benefits substantially from the research published around that time.
I2P uses several onion routing techniques, so we continue to benefit
from the significant academic interest in Tor.

Included are some attacks that may be unique to I2P.
We do not have good answers for all these attacks, however
we continue to do research and improve our defenses.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
In addition, many of these attacks are significantly easier than
they should be, due to the modest size of the current network.
While we are aware of some limitations that need to be addressed,
I2P is designed to support hundreds of thousands, or millions, of
participants.
As we continue to spread the word and grow the network,
these attacks will become much harder.

<h3 id="bruteforce">{% trans %}Brute force attacks{% endtrans %}</h3>

{{ DREAD_score(2, 1, 1, 1, 3) }}

<p>{% trans -%}
A brute force attack can be mounted by a global passive or active adversary, 
watching all the messages pass between all of the nodes and attempting to correlate
which message follows which path.  Mounting this attack against I2P should be 
nontrivial, as all peers in the network are frequently sending messages (both
end to end and network maintenance messages), plus an end to end message changes
size and data along its path.  In addition, the external adversary does not have
access to the messages either, as inter-router communication is both encrypted
and streamed (making two 1024 byte messages indistinguishable from one 2048 byte
message).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
However, a powerful attacker can use brute force to detect trends - if they 
can send 5GB to an I2P destination and monitor everyone's network connection,
they can eliminate all peers who did not receive 5GB of data.  Techniques to 
defeat this attack exist, but may be prohibitively expensive (see: 
<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/freedman02tarzan.html">Tarzan</a>'s mimics
or constant rate traffic).  Most users are not concerned with this attack, as 
the cost of mounting it are extreme (and often require illegal activity).  
However, the attack is still possible, for example by an observer at
a large ISP or an Internet exchange point.
Those who want to defend against it 
would want to take appropriate countermeasures, such as
setting low bandwidth limits, and using unpublished or encrypted leasesets for eepsites.
Other countermeasures, such as nontrivial delays and restricted routes, are
not currently implemented.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans peerselection=site_url('docs/how/peer-selection') -%}
As a partial defense against a single router or group of routers trying to route all the network's traffic,
routers contain limits as to how many tunnels can be routed through a single peer.
As the network grows, these limits are subject to further adjustment.
Other mechanisms for peer rating, selection and avoidance
are discussed on the
<a href="{{ peerselection }}">peer selection page</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>



<h3 id="timing">{% trans %}Timing attacks{% endtrans %}</h3>

{{ DREAD_score(2, 2, 2, 3, 2) }}

<p>{% trans -%}
I2P's messages are unidirectional and do not necessarily imply that a reply
will be sent.  However, applications on top of I2P will most likely have
recognizable patterns within the frequency of their messages - for instance, an 
HTTP request will be a small message with a large sequence of reply messages 
containing the HTTP response.  Using this data as well as a broad view of the 
network topology, an attacker may be able to disqualify some links as being too 
slow to have passed the message along.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
This sort of attack is powerful, but its applicability to I2P is non obvious,
as the variation on message delays due to queuing, message processing, and 
throttling will often meet or exceed the time of passing a message along a 
single link - even when the attacker knows that a reply will be sent as soon as
the message is received.  There are some scenarios which will expose fairly 
automatic replies though - the streaming library does (with the SYN+ACK) as does the 
message mode of guaranteed delivery (with the DataMessage+DeliveryStatusMessage).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans todo=site_url('get-involved/todo') -%}
Without protocol scrubbing or higher latency, global active adversaries can 
gain substantial information.  As such, people concerned with these attacks could
increase the latency (using <a href="{{ todo }}#stop">nontrivial delays</a> or 
<a href="{{ todo }}#batching">batching strategies</a>), include protocol scrubbing, or
other advanced tunnel routing <a href="{{ todo }}#batching">techniques</a>,
but these are unimplemented in I2P.

{{ DREAD_score(3, 2, 2, 3, 3) }}

<p>{% trans -%}
Intersection attacks against low latency systems are extremely powerful -
periodically make contact with the target and keep track of what peers are on
the network.  Over time, as node churn occurs the attacker will gain 
significant information about the target by simply intersecting the sets of
peers that are online when a message successfully goes through.  The cost of 
this attack is significant as the network grows, but may be feasible in some
scenarios.

In summary, if an attacker is at both ends of your tunnel at the same time,

<b>Starvation attack:</b> A hostile user may attempt to harm the network by
creating a significant number of peers in the network who are not identified as
being under control of the same entity (as with Sybil). These nodes then 
decide not to provide any resources to the network, causing existing peers 
to search through a larger network database or request more tunnels than 
should be necessary. 
Alternatively, the nodes may provide intermittent service by periodically
dropping selected traffic, or refusing connections to certain peers.
This behavior may be indistinguishable from that of a heavily-loaded or failing node.
I2P addresses these issues by maintaining <a href="{{ peerselection }}">profiles</a> on the 
peers, attempting to identify underperforming ones and simply ignoring 
them, or using them rarely.
We have significantly enhanced the
ability to recognize and avoid troublesome peers; however there are still

<b>Flooding attack:</b> A hostile user may attempt to flood the network,
a peer, a destination, or a tunnel.  Network and peer flooding is possible,
and I2P does nothing to prevent standard IP layer flooding.  The flooding of
a destination with messages by sending a large number to the target's various
inbound tunnel gateways is possible, but the destination will know this both
by the contents of the message and because the tunnel's tests will fail.  The
same goes for flooding just a single tunnel.  I2P has no defenses for a network
flooding attack.  For a destination and tunnel flooding attack, the target
identifies which tunnels are unresponsive and builds new ones.  New code could
also be written to add even more tunnels if the client wishes to handle the
larger load.  If, on the other hand, the load is more than the client can
deal with, they can instruct the tunnels to throttle the number of messages or
bytes they should pass on (once the <a href="{{ todo }}#batching">advanced tunnel

engineering practices and potentially requiring nontrivial certificates 
(e.g. HashCash) to be attached to these expensive requests should mitigate
the issue, though there may be room for an attacker to exploit various

<p>{% trans todo=site_url('get-involved/todo') -%}
Tagging attacks - modifying a message so that it can later be identified 
further along the path - are by themselves impossible in I2P, as messages 
passed through tunnels are signed.  However, if an attacker is the inbound 
tunnel gateway as well as a participant further along in that tunnel, with
collusion they can identify the fact that they are in the same tunnel (and 
prior to adding <a href="{{ todo }}#tunnelId">unique hop ids</a> and other updates,
colluding peers within the same tunnel can recognize that fact without any 
effort).  An attacker in an outbound tunnel and any part of an inbound tunnel cannot 
collude however, as the tunnel encryption pads and modifies the data separately
for the inbound and outbound tunnels.  External attackers cannot do anything,

<h3 id="partitioning">{% trans %}Partitioning attacks{% endtrans %}</h3>

{{ DREAD_score(3, 1, 1, 1, 2) }}

<p>{% trans -%}
Partitioning attacks - finding ways to segregate (technically or analytically)
the peers in a network - are important to keep in mind when dealing with a 
powerful adversary, since the size of the network plays a key role in determining
your anonymity.  Technical partitioning by cutting links between peers to create
fragmented networks is addressed by I2P's built in network database, which 
maintains statistics about various peers so as to allow any existing connections
to other fragmented sections to be exploited so as to heal the network.  However,
if the attacker does disconnect all links to uncontrolled peers, essentially
isolating the target, no amount of network database healing will fix it.  At
that point, the only thing the router can hope to do is notice that a significant
number of previously reliable peers have become unavailable and alert the client
that it is temporarily disconnected (this detection code is not implemented at
the moment).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans todo=site_url('get-involved/todo') -%}
Partitioning the network analytically by looking for differences in how routers 
and destinations behave and grouping them accordingly is also a very powerful
attack.  For instance, an attacker <a href="#harvesting">harvesting</a> the network
database will know when a particular destination has 5 inbound tunnels in their
LeaseSet while others have only 2 or 3, allowing the adversary to potentially 
partition clients by the number of tunnels selected.  Another partition is 
possible when dealing with the <a href="{{ todo }}#stop">nontrivial delays</a> and 
<a href="{{ todo }}#batching">batching strategies</a>, as the tunnel gateways and the
particular hops with non-zero delays will likely stand out.  However, this data
is only exposed to those specific hops, so to partition effectively on that 
matter, the attacker would need to control a significant portion of the network
(and still that would only be a probabilistic partition, as they wouldn't know
which other tunnels or messages have those delays).

The predecessor attack is passively gathering statistics in an attempt to see
what peers are 'close' to the destination by participating in their tunnels and
keeping track of the previous or next hop (for outbound or inbound tunnels,

ordering, an attacker would be able to see which peer shows up as 'closer'

<p>{% trans -%}
Sybil describes a category of attacks where the adversary creates arbitrarily
large numbers of colluding nodes and uses the increased numbers to help 
mounting other attacks.  For instance, if an attacker is in a network where peers
are selected randomly and they want an 80&#37; chance to be one of those peers, they
simply create five times the number of nodes that are in the network and roll 
the dice.  When identity is free, Sybil can be a very potent technique for a 
powerful adversary.  The primary technique to address this is simply to make 
identity 'non free' - <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/tarzan/">Tarzan</a>
(among others) uses the fact that IP addresses are limited, while 
IIP used 
<a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">HashCash</a> to 'charge' for creating a new
identity.  We currently have not implemented any particular technique to address
Sybil, but do include placeholder certificates in the router's and 
destination's data structures which can contain a HashCash certificate of 
appropriate value when necessary (or some other certificate proving scarcity).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

By refusing to accept or forward tunnel build requests, except to a colluding peer, a router could ensure
that a tunnel is formed wholly from its set of colluding routers.
The chances of success are enhanced if there is a large number of colluding routers,
i.e. a <a href="#sybil">Sybil attack</a>.
This is somewhat mitigated by our
<a href="{{ peerselection }}">peer profiling</a> methods used to monitor the performance
of peers.
However, this is a powerful attack as the number of routers approaches
<i>f</i> = 0.2, or 20&#37; malicious nodes, as specifed in the paper.
The malicous routers could also maintain connections to the target router and provide
excellent forwarding bandwidth for traffic over those connections, in an attempt
to manipulate the profiles managed by the target and appear attractive.
Further research and defenses may be necessary.

We use strong cryptography with long keys, and

Security features include the immediate detection of 
altered messages along the path, the inability to decrypt messages not addressed to you,
and defense against man-in-the-middle attacks.
The key sizes chosen in 2003 were quite conservative at the time, and are still longer than
those used in <a href="https://torproject.org/">other anonymity networks</a>.
We don't think the current key lengths are our biggest weakness,
especially for traditional, non-state-level adversaries;
bugs and the small size of the network are much more worrisome.
Of course, all cryptographic algorithms eventually become obsolete due to
the advent of faster processors, cryptographic research, and advancements in
methods such as rainbow tables, clusters of video game hardware, etc.
Unfortunately, I2P was not designed with easy mechanisms to lengthen keys or change

All components of the network must be open source to enable inspection, verification,

Try as we might, most nontrivial applications include errors in the design or

attack the anonymity or security of the communication running over I2P in unexpected 
ways.  To help withstand attacks against the design or protocols in use, we publish 
all designs and documentation and solicit review and criticism with 
the hope that many eyes will improve the system.

In addition, the code is being

something that isn't meeting the needs of the software system (including ease of

the software components are an essential part of security, as without them it is 
unlikely that developers would be willing to spend the time to learn the software 
enough to identify shortcomings and bugs.

<p>{% trans -%}
To the extent that active peers actually do show up in the actual blocklist,
blocking by only a subset of peers would tend to segment the network,

Blocklists are only a part (perhaps a small part) of an array of defenses

out-of-band mechanisms such as forums, blogs, etc.
