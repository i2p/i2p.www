<h2>{% trans %}Overview{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
ElGamal/AES+SessionTags is used for end-to-end encryption.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
As an unreliable, unordered, message based system, I2P uses a simple combination 
of asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms to provide data confidentiality 
and integrity to garlic messages. As a whole, the combination is referred 
to as ElGamal/AES+SessionTags, but that is an excessively verbose way to describe 
the use of 2048bit ElGamal, AES256, SHA256, and 32 byte nonces.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The first time a router wants to encrypt a garlic message to another router, 
they encrypt the keying material for an AES256 session key with ElGamal and 
append the AES256/CBC encrypted payload after that encrypted ElGamal block. 
In addition to the encrypted payload, the AES encrypted section contains the 
payload length, the SHA256 hash of the unencrypted payload, as well as a number 
of "session tags" - random 32 byte nonces. The next time the sender wants 
to encrypt a garlic message to another router, rather than ElGamal encrypt 
a new session key they simply pick one of the previously delivered session 
tags and AES encrypt the payload like before, using the session key used with 
that session tag, prepended with the session tag itself. When a router receives 
a garlic encrypted message, they check the first 32 bytes to see if it matches 
an available session tag - if it does, they simply AES decrypt the message, 
but if it does not, they ElGamal decrypt the first block.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Each session tag can be used only once so as to prevent internal adversaries 
from unnecessarily correlating different messages as being between the same 
routers. The sender of an ElGamal/AES+SessionTag encrypted message chooses 
when and how many tags to deliver, prestocking the recipient with enough tags 
to cover a volley of messages. Garlic messages may detect the successful tag 
delivery by bundling a small additional message as a clove (a "delivery status 
message") - when the garlic message arrives at the intended recipient and 
is decrypted successfully, this small delivery status message is one of the 
cloves exposed and has instructions for the recipient to send the clove back 
to the original sender (through an inbound tunnel, of course). When the original 
sender receives this delivery status message, they know that the session tags 
bundled in the garlic message were successfully delivered.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Session tags themselves have a short lifetime, after which they are 
discarded if not used. In addition, the quantity stored for each key is limited, 
as are the number of keys themselves - if too many arrive, either new or old 
messages may be dropped. The sender keeps track whether messages using session 
tags are getting through, and if there isn't sufficient communication it may 
drop the ones previously assumed to be properly delivered, reverting back 
to the full expensive ElGamal encryption.
A session will continue to exist until all its tags are exhausted or expire.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Sessions are unidirectional. Tags are delivered from Alice to Bob,
and Alice then uses the tags, one by one, in subsequent messages to Bob.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Sessions may be established between Destinations, between Routers, or
between a Router and a Destination.
Each Router and Destination maintains its own Session Key Manager to
keep track of Session Keys and Session Tags.
Separate Session Key Managers prevents correlation of multiple Destinations
to each other or a Router by adversaries.
{%- endtrans %}</p>



<h2>{% trans %}Message Reception{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
Each message received has one of two
the two possible conditions:</p>
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ol>
<li>{% trans %}It is part of an existing session and contains a Session Tag and an AES encrypted block{% endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans %}It is for a new session and contains both ElGamal and AES encrypted blocks{% endtrans %}</li>
</ol>

<p>{% trans -%}
When a router receives a message, it will first assume it is from
an existing session and attempt to look up the Session Tag and decrypt the following data using AES.
If that fails, it will assume it is for a new session and attempt to
decrypt it using ElGamal.
{%- endtrans %}</p>



<h2 id="new">{% trans %}New Session Message Specification{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
A New Session ElGamal Message contains two parts, an encrypted ElGamal block
and an encrypted AES block.

Delivery of too few tags causes the router to fall back to an expensive ElGamal encryption.

The router may assume delivery of Session Tags, or await acknowledgement before using them;
there are tradeoffs for each strategy.

<li>{% trans -%}
For very brief messages, almost the full 222 bytes of the pre-IV and padding fields in the ElGamal block
could be used for the entire message, instead of establishing a session.

<li>{% trans -%}
Evaluate padding strategy; currently we pad to a minimum of 128 bytes.
Would be better to add a few tags to small messages than pad.
{%- endtrans %}</li>

<li>{% trans -%}
Perhaps things could be more efficient if the Session Tag system was bidirectional,
so tags delivered in the 'forward' path could be used in the 'reverse' path,
thus avoiding ElGamal in the initial response.
The router currently plays some tricks like this when sending
tunnel test messages to itself.
