<h2>{% trans %}Overview{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Thank you for volunteering to run an I2P reseed server.
"Reseeding" is our term for bootstrapping new routers into the network.
New routers fetch a bundle of peer references, or "router infos", from one or more of a hardcoded list of HTTPS URLs.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans %}Privacy Policy{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
A reseed operator is a trusted role in the network.
While we do not yet have a formal privacy policy, you must ensure the privacy of our users
by not publicizing logs or IPs found in those logs, except as necessary to discuss administration issues with the I2P reseed team.

<h2>{% trans %}Getting Started{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Our reseed coordinator is "zzz" and he may be contacted at zzz at mail.i2p or zzz at i2pmail.org.
Unfortunately, he is not generally on IRC.

<h3><strong>1. </strong>Introduction</h3>

<div>The process of setting up an I2P reseed server can be accomplished in many ways.
There are currently two active</div>

<h3><strong>2. </strong>Requirements</h3>

<div>You will need to have a Linux server somewhere, and you will need to be able to
set up a reverse proxy.</div>

<div>You will need to have <code>git</code>, <code>golang-go</code>, and <code>make</code>
installed.</div>

<div>You will need to have a Linux server somewhere, and you will need to be able to
set up a reverse proxy.</div>

<h4><strong>1. </strong>Install git and golang</h4>
<h4><strong>2. </strong>Build and Test</h4>
<h4><strong>3. </strong>Run Reseed</h4>
<h4><strong>4. </strong>Backup Certificates and Keys</h4>
<h4><strong>5. </strong>Enable Autostart</h4>
<h4><strong>6. </strong>Connect Web Server to Reseed</h4>
<h4><strong>7. </strong>Test From Another Computer</h4>

<h3><strong>3. </strong>Contact Reseed Maintainer</h3>

<p>
{% trans -%}Contact us via email zzz at mail.i2p (alternatively, post in the reseed section on the zzz.i2p forum)
Provide us with details about your new reseed server:{%- endtrans %}

<h2>{% trans %}Information Required{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
When your setup is complete and ready for testing, we will need the HTTPS URL,
the SSL public key certificate (only if selfsigned), and the su3 public key certificate.
After testing is complete, these will be added to the hardcoded entries in the Java and C++ routers in the next release,
and you will start seeing traffic.
We also will need your email address so we may continue to contact you about reseed administration issues.
The email will not be made public but will be known to the other reseed operators.
You should expect that your nick or name and its association with that URL or IP will become public.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>
{% trans -%}Feel free to contact zzz at mail.i2p in case of questions or problems or post your question at zzz's forum in the reseed section.{%- endtrans %}

<h2>{% trans %}Financial Support{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Modest financial support may be available to those running reseed servers.
This support would be in partial reimbursement for your server costs.
Support will not be paid in advance and will probably not cover all your expenses.
Support is only available to those who have been running reseed servers in good standing for several months, and is based on actual need.
