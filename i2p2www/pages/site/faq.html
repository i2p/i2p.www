<p>{% trans java='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)',

I2P is written in the <a href="{{ java }}">Java programming language</a>. 
It has been tested on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OSX. 
An <a href="{{ android }}">Android port</a> is also available.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}In terms of memory usage, I2P is configured to use 128 MB of RAM by default. 
This is sufficient for browsing and IRC usage. However, other activities may require greater memory allocation. 
For example, if one wishes to run a high-bandwidth router, participate in I2P torrents or serve high-traffic hidden services, 
a higher amount of memory is required.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans rpi='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi' -%}
In terms of CPU usage, I2P has been tested to run on modest systems such as the <a href="{{ rpi }}">Raspberry Pi</a> range of single-board computers.
As I2P makes heavy use of cryptographic techniques, a stronger CPU will be better suited to handle the workload generated by I2P as well as tasks 
related to the rest of the system (i.e. Operating System, GUI, Other processes e.g. Web Browsing).{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans chart='https://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/java' -%}A comparison of some of the available Java Runtime Environments (JRE) is available here: 
<a href="{{ chart }}">{{ chart }}</a>.

Using Sun/Oracle Java or OpenJDK is recommended.

<h3 id="eepsite"><span class="permalink"><a href="#eepsite">
{% trans %}Whats an "eepsite"?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
An eepsite is a website that is hosted anonymously, a hidden service which is accessible through your web browser. 
It can be accessed by setting your web browser's HTTP proxy to use the I2P web proxy (typically it listens on localhost port 4444), and browsing to the site.

<h3 id="active"><span class="permalink"><a href="#active">

No. Unlike <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, "exit nodes" - or "outproxies" as they are referred to on the I2P network - 
are not an inherent part of the network. 
Only volunteers who specifically set up and run separate applications will relay traffic to the regular Internet. 
There are very, very few of these.

By default, I2P's HTTP Proxy (configured to run on port 4444) includes a single outproxy: false.i2p. This is run on a voluntary basis by Meeh.

There is an <a href="{{ outproxy }}">outproxy guide</a> available on our forums, if you would like to learn more about running an outproxy.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="outproxy"><span class="permalink"><a href="#outproxy">
{% trans %}I can't access regular Internet sites through I2P.{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P is primarily not intended, nor designed, to be used as a proxy to the regular internet. 
With that said, there are services which are provided by volunteers that act as proxies to clearnet based content - these are referred to as "outproxies" on the I2P network. 
There is an outproxy configured by default in I2P's HTTP client tunnel - false.i2p. 
While this service does currently exist, there is no guarantee that it will always be there as it is not an official service provided by the I2P project. 
If your main requirement from an anonymous network is the ability to access clearnet resources, we would recommend using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>.

<h3 id="proxy_safe"><span class="permalink"><a href="#proxy_safe">
{% trans -%}Is using an outproxy safe?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P does not encrypt the Internet, neither does Tor - for example, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. 
I2P and Tor both aim to transport your traffic as-is securely and anonymously over the corresponding network, to its destination. 
Any unencrypted traffic generated at your system will arrive at the outproxy (on I2P) or the exit node (on Tor) as unencrypted traffic. 
This means that you are vulnerable to snooping by the outproxy operators. 
One way to protect your outproxy traffic against this is to ensure that any traffic that will be handled by the outproxy is encrypted with TLS. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
For more information, you may read the Tor FAQ's answer to this question:

In addition, you may be vulnerable to collusion between the outproxy operator
and operators of other I2P services, if you use the same tunnels ("shared clients").
There is additional discussion about this on <a href="http://{{ zzz }}/topics/217">{{ zzz }}</a>.
This discussion has been <a href="{{ i2pforum }}">mirrored on our forums</a> as well. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans threatmodel=site_url('docs/how/threat-model') %}
Ultimately, this is a question that only you can answer because the correct answer depends on your browsing behaviour, 
your <a href="{{ threatmodel }}">threat model</a>, and how much you choose to trust the outproxy operator.

<h3 id="badcontent"><span class="permalink"><a href="#badcontent">
{% trans %}I am opposed to certain types of content. How do I keep from distributing, storing, or accessing them?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P is an anonymous network - it is designed to withstand attempts at blocking or censoring of content, thus providing a means for communication that anyone can use. 
I2P traffic that transits through your router is encrypted with several layers of encryption. 
Except in the case of a serious security vulnerability (of which none are currently known), 
it is not possible to know what the contents of the traffic are and thus not possible to distinguish between traffic which one is opposed to or not opposed to.  

 We consider the 3 parts of the question:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<ul>
<li>
{% trans -%}
<b>Distribution</b><br> 
All traffic on I2P is encrypted in multiple layers. You don't know a message's contents, source, or destination.
All traffic you route is internal to the I2P network, you are not an <a href="#exit">exit node</a> (referred to as an outproxy in our documentation).
Your only alternative is to refuse to route <i>any</i> traffic, by setting your share bandwidth or maximum participating tunnels to 0 (see above).
It would be nice if you didn't do this, you should help the network by routing traffic for others.
Over 95&#37; of users route traffic for others.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
{% trans -%}
<b>Storage</b><br> 
I2P does not do distributed storage of content, this has to be specifically installed and configured by the user (with Tahoe-LAFS, for example). 
That is a feature of a different anonymous network, <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a>.
By running I2P, you are not storing content for anyone.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
{% trans -%}
<b>Access</b><br>
If there are hidden services which you dislike, you may refrain from visiting them.
Your router will not request any content without your specific instruction to do so.{%- endtrans %}
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="browserproxy"><span class="permalink"><a href="#browserproxy">
{% trans %}How do I configure my browser?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans browserconfig=site_url('about/browser-config') -%}
The proxy config for different browsers is on a <a href="{{ browserconfig }}"> separate page</a> with screenshots. 
More advanced configs with external tools, such as the browser plug-in FoxyProxy or the proxy server Privoxy, are possible but could introduce leaks in your setup.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="irc"><span class="permalink"><a href="#irc">
{% trans %}How do I connect to IRC within I2P?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans %}
A tunnel to the main IRC server within I2P, Irc2P, is created when I2P is installed (see the <a href="http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/index.jsp">I2PTunnel configuration page</a>), and is automatically started when the I2P router starts. 
To connect to it, tell your IRC client to connect to <code>localhost 6668</code>. 
HexChat-like client users can create a new network with the server <code>localhost/6668</code> (remember to tick "Bypass proxy server" if you have a proxy server configured).
Weechat users can use the following command to add a new network:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    /server add irc2p localhost/6668
  </pre>
</code>

<h3 id="ports"><span class="permalink"><a href="#ports">
{% trans %}What ports does I2P use?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The ports that are used by I2P can be divided into 2 sections: 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ol>
  <li>{% trans %}Internet-facing ports, which are used for communication with other I2P routers{% endtrans %}</li>
  <li>{% trans %}Local ports, for local connections{% endtrans %}</li>

{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ol>
  <li>{% trans -%}Internet-facing ports<br> Note: Since release 0.7.8, new installs do not use port 8887;

The local I2P ports and the I2PTunnel ports do not need to be reachable from 
remote machines, but *should* be reachable locally.  You can also create 
additional ports for I2PTunnel instances via http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/ 
(and in turn, would need to get your firewall to allow you local access, but 
not remote access, unless desired).

<p>{% trans -%}
So, to summarize, nothing needs to be reachable by unsolicited remote peers, but
if you can configure your NAT/firewall to allow inbound UDP and TCP the <a href="http://localhost:7657/config">outbound facing port</a>, you'll
get better performance.  You will also need to be able to send outbound UDP packets
to arbitrary remote peers (blocking IPs randomly with something like PeerGuardian

      where '(System_IP)' is replaced with your System's IP address. 
      This command forwards port 7657 (the number before the first colon) to the remote system's (as specified by the string 'localhost' between the first and second colons) port 7657 (the number after the second colon). 
      Your remote I2P console will now be available on your local system as 'http://localhost:7657' and will be available for as long as your SSH session is active. 
      If you would like to start an SSH session without initiating a shell on the remote system, you can add the '-N' flag:

The SOCKS proxy has been functional since release 0.7.1. SOCKS 4/4a/5 are supported. 
I2P does not have a SOCKS outproxy so it is limited to use within I2P only.

Many applications leak sensitive information that could identify you on the Internet and this is a risk that one should be aware of when using the I2P SOCKS proxy. 
I2P only filters connection data, but if the program you intend to run sends this information as content, I2P has no way to protect your anonymity. 
For example, some mail applications will send the IP address of the machine they are running on to a mail server. 
There is no way for I2P to filter this, thus using I2P to 'socksify' existing applications is possible, but extremely dangerous.

An I2P router only needs to be seeded once, to join the network for the first

volunteer-run group of clearnet HTTPS servers.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
A typical symptom of a failed reseed is the "Known" indicator (on the left
sidebar of the router console) displaying a very small value (often less than
5) which does not increase. This can occur, among other things, if your local
firewall limits outbound traffic or if the reseed request is blocked entirely.

Unless an outproxy has been specifically set up for the service you want to connect to, this cannot be done. 
There are only three types of outproxies running right now: HTTP, HTTPS, and email. Note that there is no SOCKS outproxy.

    If you would like to set up some type of outproxy, carefully research the potential risks. 
    The I2P community may or may not be able to help with the technical aspects, feel free to ask.

{% trans -%}
Has enough memory been set aside for use by I2P? Look at the memory graph on <a href="http://localhost:7657/graphs">the graphs page</a>

Increase the setting <code>wrapper.java.maxmemory</code> in the file <code>wrapper.config</code>.

<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}Bursts of high-usage vs. constant 100% usage{%- endtrans %}</b><br>

If your router has 10 or more active peers, everything is fine. 
The router should maintain connections to a few peers at all times. 
The best way to stay "better-connected" to the network is to share more bandwidth. 
The amount of bandwidth that is shared by the router can be changed on the configuration page:

<p>{% trans -%}
No, there isn't anything wrong. 
This is normal behavior. 
All routers adjust dynamically to changing network conditions and demands. 
Routers come online and go offline depending on whether the system it is installed on is operational or not, as well as whether there is an available network connection. 
Your router is constantly updating its local Network Database. 
Tunnels which your router is participating in expire every 10 minutes and may or may not be rebuilt through your router.

{% trans %}What makes downloads, torrents, web browsing, and everything else slower on I2P as compared to the regular internet?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The encryption and routing within the I2P network adds a substantial amount of overhead and limits bandwidth. 

We can try to clarify this with the aid of a diagram:
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<img src="/_static/images/i2p_traffic_path.jpg">

<p>{% trans -%}
In this diagram, the path that some I2P traffic takes as it travels through the network is traced. 
A user's I2P router is denoted by the box labeled 'A' and an I2P Hidden Service (for example, the http://stats.i2p website) is labelled as 'B'. 
Both the client and the server are using 3-hop tunnels, these hops are represented by the boxes labelled 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'P_1', 'Q_1', 'R'_1, 'X_1', 'Y_1' and 'Z_1'.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The boxes labelled 'P', 'Q' and 'R' represent an outbound tunnel for A while the boxes labelled 'X_1', 'Y_1', 'Z_1' represent an outbound tunnel for 'B'. 
Similarly, the boxes labelled 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' represent and inbound tunnel for 'B' while the boxes labelled 'P_1', 'Q_1' and 'R_1' represent an inbound tunnel for 'A'. 
The arrows in between the boxes show the direction of traffic. 
The text above and below the arrows detail some example bandwidth between a pair of hops as well as example latencies.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
When both client and server are using 3-hop tunnels throughout, a total of 12 other I2P routers are involved in relaying traffic. 
6 peers relay traffic from the client to the server which is split into a 3-hop outbound tunnel from 'A' ('P', 'Q', 'R') and a 3-hop inbound tunnel to 'B' ('X', 'Y', 'Z').  
Similarly, 6 peers relay traffic from the server to back to the client.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
First, we can consider latency - the time that it takes for a request from a client to traverse the I2P network, reach the the server and traverse back to the client. 
Adding up all latencies we see that:
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<code>
<pre>
      40 + 100 + 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 30 ms        (client to server)
    + 60 + 40 + 80 + 60 + 100 + 20 + 40 ms        (server to client) 
    -----------------------------------
    TOTAL:                          740 ms
</pre>
</code>

<p>{% trans -%}
The total round-trip time in our example adds up to 740 ms - certainly much higher than what one would normally see while browsing regular internet websites.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Second, we can consider available bandwidth. 
This is determined through the slowest link between hops from the client and server as well as when traffic is being transmitted by the server to the client. 
For traffic going from the client to the server, we see that the available bandwidth in our example between hops 'R' &amp; 'X' as well as hops 'X' &amp; 'Y' is 32 KB/s. 
Despite higher available bandwidth between the other hops, these hops will act as a bottleneck and will limit the maximum available bandwidth for traffic from 'A' to 'B' at 32 KB/s. 
Similarly, tracing the path from server to client shows that there is maximum bandwidth of 64 KB/s - between hops 'Z_1' &amp; 'Y_1, 'Y_1' &amp; 'X_1' and 'Q_1' &amp; 'P_1'.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
We recommend increasing your bandwidth limits. 
This helps the network by increasing the amount of available bandwidth which will in turn improve your I2P experience. 
Bandwidth settings are located on the <a href="http://localhost:7657/config">http://localhost:7657/config</a> page. 
Please be aware of your internet connection's limits as determined by your ISP, and adjust your settings accordingly. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
We also recommend setting a sufficient amount of shared bandwidth - this allows for participating tunnels to be routed through your I2P router. 
Allowing participating traffic keeps your router well-integrated in the network and improves your transfer speeds.

stop the router and the wrapper. Clicking <em>Restart</em> on your

If you consider every eepsite that has ever been created, yes, most of them are down.
People and eepsites come and go.
A good way to get started in I2P is check out a list of eepsites that are currently up.
<a href="{{ eepstatus }}">{{ eepstatus }}</a> tracks active eepsites.

</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The Tanuki java service wrapper that we use opens this port &mdash;bound to localhost&mdash; in order to communicate with software running inside the JVM. 
When the JVM is launched it is given a key so it can connect to the wrapper. 
After the JVM establishes its connection to the wrapper, the wrapper refuses any additional connections.
