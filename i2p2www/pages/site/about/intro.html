<h1>{{ _('The Invisible Internet Project (I2P)') }}</h1>      
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P is an anonymous network, exposing a simple layer that applications can 
use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other. The network itself is 
strictly message based (a la 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a>), but there is a 
library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (a la 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>).  
All communication is end to end encrypted (in total there are four layers of 
encryption used when sending a message), and even the end points ("destinations") 
are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_encryption">public keys</a>).

<p>{% trans tunnelrouting=site_url('docs/how/tunnel-routing') -%}
To anonymize the messages sent, each client application has their I2P "router"
build a few inbound and outbound "<a href="{{ tunnelrouting }}">tunnels</a>" - a 
sequence of peers that pass messages in one direction (to and from the client, 
respectively).  In turn, when a client wants to send a message to another client, 
the client passes that message out one of their outbound tunnels targeting one of the 
other client's inbound tunnels, eventually reaching the destination.  Every 
participant in the network chooses the length of these tunnels, and in doing so, 
makes a tradeoff between anonymity, latency, and throughput according to their 
own needs.  The result is that the number of peers relaying each end to end 
message is the absolute minimum necessary to meet both the sender's and the 
receiver's threat model.

<p>{% trans netdb=site_url('docs/how/network-database') -%}
The first time a client wants to contact another client, they make a query 
against the fully distributed "<a href="{{ netdb }}">network 
database</a>" - a custom structured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">
distributed hash table (DHT)</a> based off the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia"> Kademlia algorithm</a>. This is done 
to find the other client's inbound tunnels efficiently, but subsequent messages 
between them usually includes that data so no further network database lookups 
are required.

<p>{% trans i2ptunnel=site_url('docs/api/i2ptunnel') -%}
Within the I2P network, applications are not restricted in how they can 
communicate - those that typically use UDP can make use of the base I2P 
functionality, and those that typically use TCP can use the TCP-like streaming
library.  We have a generic TCP/I2P bridge application 
("<a href="{{ i2ptunnel }}">I2PTunnel</a>") that enables people to forward TCP streams
into the I2P network as well as to receive streams out of the network and 
forward them towards a specific TCP/IP address.

<p>{% trans -%}
I2PTunnel is currently used to let people run their own anonymous website 
("eepsite") by running a normal webserver and pointing an I2PTunnel 'server' 
at it, which people can access anonymously over I2P with a normal web browser 
by running an I2PTunnel HTTP proxy ("eepproxy").  In addition, we use the same 
technique to run an anonymous IRC network (where the IRC server is hosted 
anonymously, and standard IRC clients use an I2PTunnel to contact it).  There 
are other application development efforts going on as well, such as one to 
build an optimized swarming file transfer application (a la 
<a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a>), a 
distributed data store (a la <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a> / 
<a href="http://mnetproject.org/">MNet</a>), and a blogging system (a fully 
distributed <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>), but those are 
not ready for use yet.

<p>{% trans -%}
I2P is not inherently an "outproxy" network - the client you send a message 
to is the cryptographic identifier, not some IP address, so the message must 
be addressed to someone running I2P.  However, it is possible for that client
to be an outproxy, allowing you to anonymously make use of their Internet 
connection.  To demonstrate this, the "eepproxy" will accept normal non-I2P 
URLs (e.g. "http://www.i2p.net") and forward them to a specific destination
that runs a <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">squid</a> HTTP proxy, allowing 
simple anonymous browsing of the normal web.  Simple outproxies like that are 
not viable in the long run for several reasons (including the cost of running 
one as well as the anonymity and security issues they introduce), but in 
certain circumstances the technique could be appropriate.

The I2P development <a href="{{ team }}">team</a> is an open group, welcome to all 
who are interested in <a href="{{ volunteer }}">getting involved</a>, and all of 
the code is <a href="{{ licenses }}">open source</a>.  The core I2P SDK and the 
current router implementation is done in Java (currently working with both 
sun and kaffe, gcj support planned for later), and there is a 
<a href="{{ sam }}">simple socket based API</a> for accessing the network from 
other languages (with a C library available, and both Python and Perl in 
development).  The network is actively being developed and has not yet reached 
the 1.0 release, but the current <a href="{{ roadmap }}">roadmap</a> describes 
our schedule.
