{% block content %}<h3>I2PTunnel migration:</h3>

<p>After upgrading to the new architecture, you'll have to do a 
little work to get your old I2PTunnel-driven servers running.  
Lets walk through a simple example.  For an eepsite with the 
old clientApp configuration, you had:</p>
<pre>
  -e "server localhost 80 myWebPriv.dat"
</pre>

<p>To provide that same functionality on the new web architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump to <a href="http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/">http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/</a></li>
<li>Click on Add new: [Server tunnel] "GO"</li>
<li><ul>
 <li>For the name: <code>"eepsite"</code></li>
 <li>For the description: <code>"My eepsite, isn't it pretty?"</code></li>
 <li>For the target host: <code>localhost</code></li>
 <li>For the target port: <code>80</code></li>
 <li>For the private key file: <code>path to "myWebPriv.dat"</code><br /> 
  (it is recommended to copy that .dat to your new install dir)</li>
 <li>Check the "Start automatically?" checkbox <code>[X]</code></li>
 <li>Click <code>"Save"</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It will come back saying:<br />
<pre>
  * Not overwriting existing private keys in /usr/home/jrandom/routers/i2p/myWebPriv.dat
  * Ready!
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it!  Creating a new I2PTunnel server works the same way too, except you
don't need to "copy the old file", obviously.  Behind the scenes, it is all driven
by the i2ptunnel.config</code> file, which you may modify externally (if you do,
hit "Reload config" on the I2PTunnel web page, which will tear down all of your 
existing tunnels and rebuild new ones)</p>

<p>Note that you WILL need to wait until your router is integrated
into the network before you are able to use the /i2ptunnel/ web
interface.  It will say "Please be patient" if you try to 
beforehand, which means that it is still trying to build the 
necessary I2PTunnel sessions it has been configured to create.  </p>{% endblock %}
