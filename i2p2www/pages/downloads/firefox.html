<h1>{{ _('I2P Easy Install Bundle (Beta) for Windows') }}</h1>
<p>{% trans nsis="/nsis" -%}
The I2P Firefox Browser Profile has been expanded into the new I2P Easy Install
Bundle, which is in Beta. If you already have an I2P Router installed, it is
still safe to use this installer to configure your I2P Browser. Your existing
I2P Settings will be left untouched. If you do not have an I2P router installed,
then you do not need to install I2P. This package will install I2P at the same
time it installs the browser profile. This page has been kept to document the
motivations and design of the included Firefox profile. To learn more about the
new bundle, visit <a href="{{ nsis }}">The Easy Install Bundle Page</a>.

The latest I2P Easy-Install bundle for Windows has been released unsigned.
Please verify that the hashes match the downloads when installing the bundle.

Now that you have joined the I2P network, you will want to see I2P Sites and and 
other content that is hosted on the network. The Firefox browser profile is 
pre-configured to allow you to access the content available on the network.

<h2>{{ _('Why should I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
Browsers are highly complex and powerful engines for executing code and displaying
information obtained mainly from strangers on the internet. By default, they
tend to leak a great deal of information about the person using them to the servers
they retrieve information from. Using this browser profile allows you to become
part of a "common" set of very similar browser users, instead of appearing unique
or revealing details of your hardware or software. Because this involves disabling 
some browser features, this also reduces the attack surface available to outsiders. 
This keeps you safer while browsing the Invisible Web.

<h2>{{ _('How do I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans firefox="https://www.mozilla.org/" -%}
First, download and install <a href="{{ firefox }}">Firefox</a>, then,
just download and install this installer(below). To
start an installer, "double-click" the downloaded .exe file.

<h2>{{ _('What is in it?') }}</h2>
<p><strong>{% trans -%}
A Jpackaged I2P Router: {%- endtrans %}</strong>
{% trans -%}The I2P router is "jpackaged" which means that it includes all
the required Java components it needs to run successfully. It does not require
a separate Java installation, because it bundles a Java 16 Runtime which is only
used for I2P.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p><strong>{% trans -%}
Browser Extensions: {%- endtrans %}</strong>
{% trans -%}The browser profile also includes both the NoScript and HTTPSEverywhere plugin for
better protection Javascript based attacks and HTTPS support where available. It
also keeps your I2P search activity separate from your visible internet search
activity. The profile configures the I2P Proxy for all sites and browser features.
I2P In Private Browsing is used to provide I2P-Specific browser integrations.

<h2>{{ _('How is it different from Tor Browser?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
This is not a fork of Firefox. Instead, it is a browser profile with pre-configured
settings, combined with an I2P router and some launcher scripts. That means that
it requires Firefox(Or Tor Browser) to be installed before you can use it. This
is for security reasons, it is important that you are able to recieve reliable
updates from a trustworthy vendor.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P routers are designed to have long uptimes, and so unlike Tor Browser, the
lifetime of your I2P Router is not tied to the lifetime of your I2P browsing
session. The browser profile will manage your history, your browser's local
storage and cache, and your browsing context but it will never stop your I2P
router on its own. You may stop the router using the web interface on the
router console homepage.
