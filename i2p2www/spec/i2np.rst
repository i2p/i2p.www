Overview
========

The I2P Network Protocol (I2NP) is the layer above the
I2P transport protocols. It is a router-to-router protocol.
It is used for network database lookups and replies, for creating
tunnels, and for encrypted router and client data messages.
I2NP messages may be sent point-to-point to another router,
or sent anonymously through tunnels to that router.


.. _versions:

Protocol Versions
=================

All routers must publish their I2NP protocol version in the "router.version"
field in the RouterInfo properties.
This version field is the API version, indiciating the level
of support for various I2NP protocol features, and is not necessarily the
actual router version.

If alternative (non-Java) routers wish to publish any version information about
the actual router implementation, they must do so in another property.
Versions other than those listed below are allowed. Support will be determined
through a numeric comparison; for example, 0.9.13 implies support for 0.9.12
features.  Note that the "coreVersion" property is no longer published
in the router info, and was never used for determination
of the I2NP protocol version.

A basic summary of the I2NP protocol versions is as follows. For details, see
below.

Note that there are also transport-related features and compatibility issues;
see the NTCP and SSU transport documentation for details.


.. _structures:

Common structures
=================

The following structures are elements of multiple I2NP messages.
They are not complete messages.

.. _struct-I2NPMessageHeader:

I2NP message header
-------------------

Description
```````````
Common header to all I2NP messages, which contains important information like a checksum, expiration date, etc.

Contents
````````

There are three separate formats used, depending on context;
one standard format, and two short format.

The standard 16 byte format contains
1 byte [Integer]_ specifying the type of this message, followed by a 4 byte
[Integer]_ specifying the message-id.  After that there is an expiration
[Date]_, followed by a 2 byte [Integer]_ specifying the length of the message
payload, followed by a [Hash]_, which is truncated to the first byte. After
that the actual message data follows.

The short formats use a 4 byte expiration in seconds instead of an
8 byte expiration in milliseconds.
The short formats do not contain a checksum or size,
those are provided by the encapsulations, depending on context.

Standard (16 bytes):

  |type|      msg_id       |  expiration
  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                           |  size   |chks|
  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

  Short (SSU, 5 bytes) (obsolete):

  +----+----+----+----+----+
  |type| short_expiration  |

  Short (NTCP2, SSU2, and ECIES-Ratchet Garlic Cloves, 9 bytes):

  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
   tion|
  +----+

  type :: `Integer`
          length -> 1 byte
          purpose -> identifies the message type (see table below)

  msg_id :: `Integer`
            length -> 4 bytes
            purpose -> uniquely identifies this message (for some time at least)
                       This is usually a locally-generated random number, but
                       for outgoing tunnel build messages it may be derived from
                       the incoming message. See below.

  expiration :: `Date`
                8 bytes
                date this message will expire

  short_expiration :: `Integer`
                      4 bytes
                      date this message will expire (seconds since the epoch)

  size :: `Integer`
          length -> 2 bytes
          purpose -> length of the payload

  chks :: `Integer`
          length -> 1 byte
          purpose -> checksum of the payload
                     SHA256 hash truncated to the first byte

  data ::
          length -> $size bytes
          purpose -> actual message contents
{% endhighlight %}

Notes
`````
* When transmitted over [SSU]_, the 16-byte standard header is not used. Only a
  1-byte type and a 4-byte expiration in seconds are included. The message id
  and size are incorporated in the SSU data packet format.
  The checksum is not required since errors are caught in decryption.

* When transmitted over [NTCP2]_ or [SSU2]_, the 16-byte standard header is not used. Only a
  1-byte type, 4-byte message id, and a 4-byte expiration in seconds are included.
  The size is incorporated in the NTCP2 and SSU2 data packet formats.
  The checksum is not required since errors are caught in decryption.

* The standard header is also required for I2NP messages contained in other
  messages and structures (Data, TunnelData, TunnelGateway, and GarlicClove).
  As of release 0.8.12, to reduce overhead, checksum verification is disabled
  at some places in the protocol stack. However, for compatibility with older
  versions, checksum generation is still required. It is a topic for future
  research to determine points in the protocol stack where the far-end router's
  version is known and checksum generation can be disabled.

* The short expiration is unsigned and will wrap around on Feb. 7, 2106. As of
  that date, an offset must be added to get the correct time.

.. _struct-BuildRequestRecord:

  Delivery Instructions :: as defined below
         Length varies but is typically 1, 33, or 37 bytes

  I2NP Message :: Any I2NP Message

  Clove ID :: 4 byte `Integer`

  Expiration :: `Date` (8 bytes)

  Certificate :: Always NULL in the current implementation (3 bytes total, all zeroes)
{% endhighlight %}

Notes
`````
* Cloves are never fragmented. When used in a Garlic Clove, the first bit of
  the Delivery Instructions flag byte specifies encryption. If this bit is 0,
  the clove is not encrypted. If 1, the clove is encrypted, and a 32 byte
  Session Key immediately follows the flag byte. Clove encryption is not fully
  implemented.

* See also the garlic routing specification [GARLICSPEC]_.

* Maximum length is a function of the total length of all the cloves and the
  maximum length of the GarlicMessage.

* In the future, the certificate could possibly be used for a HashCash to "pay"
  for the routing.

* The message can be any I2NP message (including a GarlicMessage, although that
  is not used in practice). The messages used in practice are DataMessage,
  DeliveryStatusMessage, and DatabaseStoreMessage.

* The Clove ID is generally set to a random number on transmit and is checked
  for duplicates on receive (same message ID space as top-level Message IDs)


.. _struct-GarlicCloveDeliveryInstructions:

Garlic Clove Delivery Instructions
----------------------------------

This is the format used for both ElGamal-encrypted [CRYPTO-ELG]_
and ECIES-AEAD-X25519-Ratchet encrypted [ECIES]_ garlic cloves.

This specification is for Delivery Instructions inside Garlic Cloves only.
Note that "Delivery Instructions" are also used inside Tunnel Messages, where
the format is significantly different.  See the Tunnel Message documentation
[TMDI]_ for details.  Do NOT use the following specification for Tunnel Message
Delivery Instructions!

Session key and delay are unused and never present, so the three
possible lengths are 1 (LOCAL), 33 (ROUTER and DESTINATION), and 37 (TUNNEL) bytes.

  reply token ::
              4 bytes
              If greater than zero, a `DeliveryStatusMessage`
              is requested with the Message ID set to the value of the Reply Token.
              A floodfill router is also expected to flood the data to the closest floodfill peers
              if the token is greater than zero.

  reply_tunnelId ::
                 4 byte `TunnelId`
                 Only included if reply token &gt; 0
                 This is the `TunnelId` of the inbound gateway of the tunnel the response should be sent to
                 If $reply_tunnelId is zero, the reply is sent directy to the reply gateway router.

  reply gateway ::
                32 bytes
                Hash of the `RouterInfo` entry to reach the gateway
                Only included if reply token &gt; 0
                If $reply_tunnelId is nonzero, this is the router hash of the inbound gateway
                of the tunnel the response should be sent to.
                If $reply_tunnelId is zero, this is the router hash the response should be sent to.

  data ::
       If type == 0, data is a 2-byte `Integer` specifying the number of bytes that follow,
                     followed by a gzip-compressed `RouterInfo`. See note below.
       If type == 1, data is an uncompressed `LeaseSet`.
       If type == 3, data is an uncompressed `LeaseSet2`.
       If type == 5, data is an uncompressed `EncryptedLeaseSet`.
       If type == 7, data is an uncompressed `MetaLeaseSet`.
{% endhighlight %}

Notes
`````
* For security, the reply fields are ignored if the message is received down a
  tunnel.

* The key is the "real" hash of the RouterIdentity or Destination, NOT the
  routing key.

* Types 3, 5, and 7 are as of release 0.9.38. See proposal 123 for more information.
  These types should only be sent to routers with release 0.9.38 or higher.

* As an optimization to reduce connections, if the type is a LeaseSet, the
  reply token is included, the reply tunnel ID is nonzero, and the
  reply gateway/tunnelID pair is found in the LeaseSet as a lease,
  the recipient may reroute the reply to any other lease in the LeaseSet.

* To hide the router OS and implementation, match the Java router implementation
  of gzip by setting the modification time to 0 and the OS byte to 0xFF,
  and set XFL to 0x02 (max compression, slowest algorithm).
  See RFC 1952.
  First 10 bytes of the compressed router info will be (hex):

Reply Encryption
````````````````

NOTE: ElGamal routers are deprecated as of API 0.9.58.
As the recommended minimum floodfill version to query is now 0.9.58,
implementations need not implement encryption for ElGamal floodfill routers.
ElGamal destinations are still supported.

Flag bit 4 is used in combination with bit 1 to determine the reply encryption mode.
Flag bit 4 must only be set when sending to routers with version 0.9.46 or higher.
See proposals 154 and 156 for details.

In the table below,
"DH n/a" means that the reply is not encrypted.
"DH no" means that the reply keys are included in the request.
"DH yes" means that the reply keys are derived from the DH operation.

ECIES to ECIES (0.9.49)
`````````````````````````````

ECIES destination or router sends a lookup to a ECIES router.
Supported as of 0.9.49.

ECIES routers were introduced in 0.9.48, see [Prop156]_.
ECIES destinations and routers may use the same format as in
the "ECIES to ElG" section above, with reply keys included in the request.
The lookup message encryption is specified in [ECIES-ROUTERS]_.
The requester is anonymous.


ECIES to ECIES (future)
`````````````````````````````

This option is not yet fully defined.
See [Prop156]_.


Notes
`````
* Prior to 0.9.16, the key may be for a RouterInfo or LeaseSet, as they are in
  the same key space, and there was no flag to request only a particular type
  of data.

* Encryption flag, reply key, and reply tags as of release 0.9.7.

* Encrypted replies are only useful when the response is through a tunnel.

* The number of included tags could be greater than one if alternative DHT
  lookup strategies (for example, recursive lookups) are implemented.

* The lookup key and exclude keys are the "real" hashes, NOT routing keys.

* Types 3, 5, and 7 may be returned as of release 0.9.38. See proposal 123 for more information.

Notes
`````
* The 'from' hash is unauthenticated and cannot be trusted.

* The returned peer hashes are not necessarily closer to the key than the
  router being queried.
  For replies to regular lookups, this facilitates discovery of new floodfills
  and "backwards" searching (further-from-the-key) for robustness.

* The key for an exploration lookup is usually generated randomly.
  Therefore, the response's non-floodfill peer_hashes may be selected using an
  optimized algorithm, such as providing peers that are close to the key but not
  necessarily the closest in the entire local network database, to avoid an
  inefficient sort or search of the entire local database.
  Other strategies such as caching may also be appropriate.
  This is implementation-dependent.
	
* Typical number of hashes returned: 3

* Recommended maximum number of hashes to return: 16

* The lookup key, peer hashes, and from hash are "real" hashes, NOT routing
  keys.

  4 length bytes the minimum size of the Garlic Message is 164 bytes.

* Actual max length is less than 64 KB; see [I2NP]_.

* See also the ElGamal/AES specification [ELG-AES]_.

* See also the garlic routing specification [GARLIC]_.

* The 128 byte minimum size of the AES encrypted block is not currently
  configurable, however the minimum size of a DataMessage in a GarlicClove in a
  GarlicMessage, with overhead, is 128 bytes anyway. A configurable option to
  increase the minimum size may be added in the future.
