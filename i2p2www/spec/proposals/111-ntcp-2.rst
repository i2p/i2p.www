Overview
========

This proposal is about overhauling the NTCP transport to improve its resistance
to various forms of automated identification and attacks.


Motivation
==========

NTCP data is encrypted after the first message (and the first message appears to
be random data), thus preventing protocol identification through "payload
analysis". It is still vulnerable to protocol identification through "flow
analysis". That's because the first 4 messages (i.e. the handshake) are fixed
length (288, 304, 448, and 48 bytes).

By adding random amounts of random data to each of the messages, we can make it
a lot harder.


Design Goals
============

- Support NTCP 1 and 2 on a single port, auto-detect,
  and published as a single "transport" (i.e. Router Address) in the netdb
- Publish support for version 1 only, 2 only, or 1+2 in the netdb
  in a separate field, and default to version 1 only
  (don't bind version support to a particular router version)
- Ensure that all implementations (java/i2pd/kovri/go) can add version 2 support
  (or not) on their own schedules
- Add random padding to all NTCP messages including handshake and data messages
  (i.e. length obfuscation so all messages aren't a multiple of 16 bytes)
- Obfuscate the contents of messages that aren't encrypted (1 and 2), sufficiently
  so that DPI boxes and AV signatures can't easily classify them.
  Also ensure that the messages going to
  a single peer or set of peers do not have a similar pattern of bits
- Fix loss of bits in DH due to Java format (ticket #1112),
  possibly (probably?) by switching to X25519
- Switch to a real key derivation function (KDF) rather than using the DH result as-is?
- Add "probing resistance" (as Tor calls it), this includes replay resistance
- Maintain 2-way authenticated key exchange (2W-AKE).
  1W-AKE is not sufficient for our application.
- Continue to use the variable-type, variable-length signatures (from the published
  RouterIdentity signing key) for authentication. Do not rely on a separate published key.
- Add options/version in handshake for future extensibility
- Add resistance to malicious MitM TCP segmentation if possible
- Don't add significantly to CPU required for connection setup;
  if possible, reduce it significantly
- Replace HMAC-MD5 with something more secure (see RFC 6151),
  possibly HMAC-SHA256 or Poly1305 (see alternatives below).
- If possible, reduce the 4-message, two-round-trip handshake to
  a 3-message, one-round-trip handshake, as in SSU.
  This would require moving Bob's signature in message 4 to message 2.
  Research the reason for 4 messages in the ten-year-old email/status/meeting archives.
- Maintain timestamps for replay and skew detection
- Avoid any year 2038 issues in timestamps, must work until at least 2106
- Increase max message size from 16K to 32K or 64K
- Any new crypto should be readily available in libraries for use
  in Java (1.7), C++, and Go router implementations.
- Include representatives of Java, C++, and Go router developers in the design
- Minimize changes (but there will still be a lot).
- Support both versions in a common set of code
  (this may not be possible and is implementation-dependent in any case).



Non-Goals
=========

- Bullet-proof DPI resistance... that would be pluggable transports, proposal #109
- A TLS-based transport... that would be proposal #104
- Don't change the symmetric stream crypto, continue to use AES-CBC-256
  (but do add flags in the handshake so we can change later).
  However, why is using the last 16 bytes of the previous message as the IV
  better than just using counter mode? To be researched.
  Salsa 20 also an option (see alternatives below)
- Post-Quantum (PQ) Crypto resistance
- Deniability (there's signatures in there)


Related Goals
=============

- Implement a NTCP 1/2 test setup




Router Address
==============

Transport identifier is "NTCP" as before.

Routers would publish "ver=1,2" in the Router Address (not the Router Info)
if they support both NTCP 1 and NTCP 2 on the same port.
That's what we would do in Java.

"ver=1" is NTCP 1 only. This is the default if no "ver" is present.

"ver=2" is NTCP 2 only. This can't be used for a long time, as it's not
backwards-compatible. But sometime in the future, implementers could
support version 2 only.

Alternative: Make it something easier to parse, where it's the integer
representation of a bitfield. ver=3 means you support version 1 and 2.
ver=7 means you support versions 1, 2, and 3.

Notes
-----

- The details that follow have not been updated to include a new DH or HMAC algorithm





1) Session Request
------------------

Message 1 is obfuscated with random padding,
and the options block is AES-encrypted with Bob's (publicly known) router hash
as a cheap form of obfuscation.
There is no requirement that the session request be unbreakably encrypted,
e.g. with Bob's encryption key, as there's nothing secret in here and that would be
too expensive.


current:
- 256 byte X
- 32 byte H(x) ^ H(RI)

proposed:

- 16 byte MAC
- 16 byte AES-encrypted options block
  - 1 byte protocol version (2)
  - 3 bytes options (nothing now, all 0)
  - 2 byte DH type (implies length of X)

    0. Old ElG with leading zero (256 bytes) (unused in NTCP 2)
    1. New ElG without leading zero (256 bytes)
    2. ECDH? 25519?

  - 2 byte block/stream cipher type

    0. AES CBC
    1. Salsa20? ChaCha?

  - 4 byte timestamp (unsigned seconds since epoch, wrap around in 2106)
  - 2 bytes unused, set to 0
  - 2 byte padding count beyond X, to a minimum packet size of 289 bytes
- DH X (256 bytes or as implied by DH type)
- Random padding bytes as specified, to a minimum of 289 bytes.
  No requirement for total message size to be a multiple of 16.

Options block is AES ECB encrypted with Bob's 32-byte router hash as the key.
This is the only portion of the message that is encrypted.

MAC: Standard 16-byte HMAC-MD5 (not the nonstandard one we use in SSU)
MAC covers only the options block.
MAC key is the first 16 bytes of Bob's router hash.
Encrypt-then-MAC.

To determine if incoming message is version 1 or version 2:

  Method 1
	Read 32 bytes.
	If the MAC is good then assume it is version 2, otherwise it is version 1.
        There's a tiny chance the MAC could be good but it's really version 1.

  Method 2
	Read 288 bytes.
	If there is a 289th byte pending, assume it is version 2, otherwise it is version 1.
	This method is vulnerable to MiTM segmentation at 288 bytes.

Timestamp is used for replay detection. Keep a cache of recent MACs for a time period,
reject duplicates, and reject timestamps beyond the cache lifetime or too far in future.


2) Session Created
------------------

The only change is adding a variable amount of padding at the end.
TODO: Replace this with the full spec

- Y type and length as specified in message 1
- The last 16 bytes of Y are used as the IV.
- Take the (former) first two padding bytes and make them the number
  of padding bytes to follow, 0 - 65535
- Padding up to the first multiple of 16 (0-15 bytes) is required and encrypted.
- Padding after that is not encrypted, not used for next IV,
  no requirement for total message size to be a multiple of 16.
- The last 16 encrypted bytes are used as the next IV in message 4


3) Session Confirm A
--------------------

The only change is adding a variable amount of padding at the end.
TODO: Replace this with the full spec

- The last 16 bytes of X from message 1 are used as the IV.
- Take the (former) first two padding bytes and make them the number
  of padding bytes to follow after the sig, 0 - 65535
- Then pad with 0-15 bytes so that the message through the signature is a multiple of 16 bytes.
- Then the signature
- Padding after that is not encrypted, not used for next IV,
  no requirement for total message size to be a multiple of 16.
- The last 16 encrypted bytes are used as the next IV in the first data transfer.


4) Session Confirm B
--------------------

The only change is adding a variable amount of padding at the end.
TODO: Replace this with the full spec

- The last 16 bytes of the encrypted contents of message 2 are used as the IV.
- Take the (former) first two padding bytes and make them the number
  of padding bytes to follow, 0 - 65535
- Padding up to the first multiple of 16 (0-15 bytes) is required and encrypted.
- Padding after that is not encrypted, not used for next IV,
  no requirement for total message size to be a multiple of 16.
- The last 16 encrypted bytes are used as the next IV in the first data transfer.


5) Data Packets
---------------

Add non-mod-16 padding after the checksum:


- Old:
  - 2 byte data length
  - Data
  - Padding to multiple of 16 (including checksum)
  - 4 byte checksum

- New:
  - 2 byte data length
  - Data
  - 2 byte post-checksum padding count, 0-65535
  - 0-15 bytes Padding to multiple of 16 (including checksum)
  - 4 byte checksum
  - Random Padding (unencrypted, not used in IV, not covered by checksum)


Alternatives
============

- Poly1305 instead of HMAC-MD5?
- Something else instead of AES for obfuscating the options block in message 1?
- ECDH or 25519 ECDH instead of ElG DH? Note that "25519 ECDH" is now called "X25519"
- Salsa20 (or derivatives) instead of AES?

When we add support for any new DH or block/stream cipher types,
we will have to bump the advertised version in the Router Address.
